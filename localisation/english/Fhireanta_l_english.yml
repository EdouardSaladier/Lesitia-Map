FHI_unwilling_head_of_state_desc:0 "§LThe head of the Arbitration Commission, Laomann IlleBhàin never asked to lead his country, but nevertheless had to assume the responsibility after the collapse of the Arnfreyr government. Although the Arbitration Commission's bureaucracy is mostly able to keep the state running by itself, its leader remains an inexperienced politician, and both his rule and his administration are under criticism.§!"

FHI.40.t:0 "The Peace Preservation Act of [GetYear]"
FHI.40.d:0 "To ensure stability amidst social and political turmoil, the Arbitration Commission has introduced the Peace Preservation Act of [GetYear] to restore order and cement the Commission's authority. The Act empowers the Security Directorate to arrest anyone suspected of terrorism and grand the Arbitration Commission exclusive jurisdiction over all other offenses under this Act While it was officially written as an anti-terrorist legistlation, the law shall effectively grant the Arbitration Commission legal grounds to fight against Aiseirigh and prosecute its members."
FHI.40.a:0 "We will restore Order and deal with the Aiseirigh Bandits!"
FHI.40.b:0 "This law will not stop us!"
FHI.41.t:0 "Peace Preservation Law Trampled Over"
FHI.42.t:0 "The Righteous Militias of Peace and Justice"
FHI.42.d:0 "In order to deal with the Aiseirigh movement and its militias, the Arbitration Commission has decided to create its own militias called the \"Righteous Militias of Peace and Justice\". These militias are under direct order of the Arbitration Commission and have been provided weapons and training by the Security Directorate. This should give the Arbitration commission a mean to enforce its rule and fight back against the militias loyal to Aiseirigh when regular law enforcement units are no longer sufficient."
FHI.42.a:0 "These heroes shall defend our nation from its internal enemies!"
FHI.42.b:0 "We shall see which militia is the strongest one..."
FHI.43.t:0 "Special Assembly Orders to Disband the Righteous Militias"
FHI.43.d:0 "In a blow to the Arbitration Commission's plans, the Councilor Special Assembly ordered the commission to Disband its own militias, denouncing their creation as an attempt to cling into power illegally. With its legitimacy dependant on the Councilor Assembly, the Arbitration had no choice but to comply and disband the \"Righteous Militias of Peace and Justice\" mere days after their creation. Without a militia of their own, the Commission is now vulnerable to Aiseirigh once again..."
FHI.43.a:0 "If you wanted to stop us, it is too little too late."
FHI.44.t:0 "The Raptor Defense Forces"
FHI.44.d:0 "In order to deal more effectively with the Aiseirigh threat, the Security Directorate expended its own forces by integrating the former Arnfreyr loyalists into a new unit called the \"Raptor Defense Forces\". This unit shall ensure the stability of the Commission-Directorate coalition rule and their service to the regime guarantee the protection of their family, thus guaranteeing their loyalty to the regime."
FHI.44.a:0 "They shall defend Fhíreanta no matter the cost."
FHI.44.b:0 "Scandalous! Treacherous! An insult to the Fhíreantan nation!"
FHI.45.t:0 "Special Assembly Orders to Disband the Raptor Defense Forces"
FHI.45.d:0 "After the Special Assembly, the councilors have voted to order the Security Directorate to immediately Disband the \"Raptor Defense Forces\". Without its new unit, the ability of the Security Directorate to fight against Aiseirigh is jeopardised."
FHI.45.a:0 "Raptor should not be trusted with guns anyway."
FHI.46.t:0 "Commission Action (should not be visible)"
FHI.46.d:0 "§RIf you ever see this event please make a bug report!§!"
FHI.47.t:0 "Arnfreyr Supporters Assets Seized by the Commission"
FHI.47.d:0 "As a part of the De-Glaurungirisation policy, the Arbitration Commission moved to seize financial assets belonging to the Arnfreyr supporter who enriched themselves through collaboration with Glaurungir. With most of their capital gone, a populace hostile to them, and a political establishment determined to neutralise them, it is effectively the end of the Arnfreyr Chapter's influence over Fhíreantan politics."
FHI.47.a:0 "One less problem to deal with."
FHI.47.b:0 "This isn't enough, they should have paid with their blood!"
FHI.48.t:0 "Arnfreyr Supporters Offered Cooperation for Loyalty"
FHI.49.t:0 "Arbitration Commission Ordered to Cease Activities"
FHI.49.d:0 "Following an Agreement between the Councilor Assembly and Ruairidh Blàrach, the High Religious Council finally agreed to order the commission to stop interfering with the internal affairs of the country. With no legitimacy left, it seems like the days of the Arbitration Commission are numbered..."
FHI.49.a:0 "Good ridance. Now, our rise shall be inevitable!"
FHI.50.t:0 "Arbitration Commission Fails to Launch any Activity"
FHI.50.d:0 "Due to heavy internal opposition from councilors friendly to the Aiseirigh cause as well as public pressure, it seems that the Arbitration Commission found itself completely unable to launch any operation this month. This failure to act might give the Aiseirigh movement the momentum they need to further entrench their position."
FHI.50.a:0 "Excellent, they won't be in our way for a while."
FHI.51.t:0 "Arbitration Commission Pays Protesters to Stop Unrest"
FHI.51.d:0 "Using a large quantity of financial assets some believe to have been seized from the former Arnfreyr loyalists, it seems that to deal with the Anti-Commission protests, the Arbitration Commission simply decided to pay some of the protesters. With the group already lacking internal cohesion and shared goals, it was enough to demoralize the movement and allow law enforcement to easily deal with the few remaining protesters."
FHI.51.a:0 "Take this money, and fuck off!"
FHI.51.b:0 "We do not need support from people who can be bought so easily anyway."
FHI.52.t:0 "Arbitration Commission Fails to Buy Out Protesters"
FHI.53.t:0 "Arbitration Commission Fails to Establish Rule by Decree"
FHI.54.t:0 "Arbitration Commission Cooperation with Industrialists Exposed"
FHI.55.t:0 "Arbitration Commission Fails to Enact Peace Preservation Law"
FHI.55.d:0 "Intended to uphold the safety and security of the state, it seems that the Peace Preservation Law the Commission prepared failed to gather enough support among the councilors to be enacted. Without any alternative, the Arbitration Commission has no choice but to modify the law and re-attempt to enact it later. In the meantime, it has little to no way to oppose the fulgurous rise of the Aiseirigh movement."
FHI.55.a:0 "They will not have a second chance at enacting it."
FHI.56.t:0 "Arbitration Commission Spreads Anti-Aiseirigh Propaganda"
