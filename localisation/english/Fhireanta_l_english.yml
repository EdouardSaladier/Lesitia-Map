###Events

FHI.3.t:0 "Writing a new History"
FHI.3.d:0 "While we are getting rid of Glaurungir's lingering influence on our nation, it is crucial for Fhireanta to reclaim and reconstruct our true history. The centuries-long occupation by Glaurungir has resulted in the rewriting and distortion of our historical narrative, as well as in the loss of most reliable source of information. Therefore, it is imperative that we interpret the fragments of our past that remain to reconstruct our nation's history.\nWhile rewriting our history is certainly a challenge, it is also an opportunity for us to use our history to keep our population united and re-affirm our core values. We have several options available: We could either try to put the emphasis on unity and our common history, promote the glory of our faith or praise the heroism of our past heroes. Another controversial option would be to emphasize how we destroyed our enemies to safeguard our nation. Finally, we could also try to establish a special committee of historians who would prioritize historical accuracy and objectivity, but they would need at least a year before being able to pronounce themselves."
