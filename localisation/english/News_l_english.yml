SYM_news.1.t:0 "Collapse of the Symbiotic Federation"
SYM_news.1.d:0 "The young democratic federation of insects has seemingly come to an end. Two years after gaining independence from the empire of Glaurungir, the Symbiotic Federation has suffered massive stability issues trying to carve its place in a post nuclear world. \n \n The election of Maximilian Rex was seemingly the breaking point of the federation. A few weeks afterward, Ultima Mormorare, an army colonel and prominent figure in the National Revival Party, staged a takeover of several cities in the Federation’s heartland before declaring independence. Creating his own regime overnight. There has been very little response from the federal government as officials vanish from their positions and military staff have mutinied. \n \n It seems that the Symbiotic Federation is collapsing under its own weight. Bloodshed is seemingly inevitable."
