### LEADER DESC
SYM_Amber_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 45\n\nAmber was born in a small rural town once called "Vaselios", later the town would be renamed after him, getting the name "Ambersville", the grasshopper had a very humble and simple early life, his family being on the poor side of things, but still being able to afford a decent life, but there was a problem they faced quite often, that being the reptiles occupying the region, like in many other regions the occupiers were very cruel and destructive, and here was no different, with Amber's dad being killed when he was only 16, forcing him and his mom to make it on their own.\n\nDue to this experience the insect always opposed the Empire, for a few years he kept himself quiet so he wouldn't cause trouble to his mother, but after her passing he had nothing holding him back, he would show his hate towards the Empire by starting to unite many of the partisan and resistance movements in the region into a single more organised one due to his great speaches and promises, calling this united front the "Federal Force", on the years leading up to the nuclear conflict he would continue resisting, making the federal force larger and making sure they made the life of the reptiles of the south a living nightmare before what he calls the "Shining Miracle", which is the nukes, where he and his force were finally able to rise up and free themselves.\n\nBut one thing was clear, the united front wouldn't last very long, in fact it only lasted a few weeks before fracturing itself back into many small groups, the country had no trouble initially being formed, but now people were wondering why the nation needed to continue existing, many wanting their regions to be free like in the past instead of this artifical state, Amber's motives were brought up, a good part of the population accusing him of being power hungry due to his wish to continue the Federation, because of this he would become much more quiet, with his confidence getting lower every day, not being sure if he was still capable for the position of president, now only time will tell what is the end of his story."
SYM_Lua_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 36\n\nLuã is native to the region of Kakrikea, also being it's governor, being born in the city of Zentra.\n\nHe always showed despise towards the reptiles and always started fights with them in his teenage and young adult years, he quickly showed himself as a capable fighter, specially since he was able to defeat opponents two times his size just by brute force alone, of course he isn't invincible, most times being overconfident and planning things poorly, causing him to get beat up quite a bit on his many brawls, even leaving some scars around his body, but even with that his abilites were quickly noticed by resistance members, causing them to invite him into the movement and later make him be part of the insurrection army.\n\nDue to his confidence and deeds during the liberation war he was chosen by the queen to be the governor of the region as she was finally stepping down from power, his reign has been quite the authoritarian one, but with slight flirting towards democracy, he seems to support the more liberal pro-Federation faction inside of the army."
SYM_Godofredo_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 54\n\nGodofredo is native to the region of Seda, born in the city of Beiramar.\n\nGodofredo was always a great planner with an eye for logistics, leading and planning many local revolts, also being the founder of many of the original resistance groups, helping bugs like Amber to get into power, he trained and commanded many of the generals serving the Federation and for that he was given the highest rank of the army.\n\nAs it seems Godofredo's tactics and ideas are a bit outdated, with a lot of generals commenting on it, causing him to not hold as much power as he once did in the academy and his influence is truly minimal over the others, due to this he is pretty bitter towards everyone, making so he will refuse to join any revolt or revolution just out of spite."
SYM_Alessandro_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 46\n\nAlessandro is native to the region of Mavildea, born in the city of Farend.\n\nAlessandro wasn't the most active resistance fighter, being mostly silent during the occupation and simply learning to live with it, until he saw the writing on the wall and decided to join one of the many resistance groups, there he showed himself as a decent planner and a even better defender, being great at preparing fortifications and barriers, as well as holding out for many days against incoming attacks.\n\nThe bee still isn't very active politically, he basically has the same mindset as he had on the past, seeing the Federation as just another country controlling his city, therefore he is pretty indifferent towards popular movements and will mostly just stick with the status quo."
SYM_Oscar_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 48\n\nOscar is native to the region of Zhafollis, born in the small rural town of Vaselios, now known as Ambersville.\n\nOscar is president Amber's older brother, during the occupation Oscar was much more active than Amber, being present in many of the popular revolts and major acts of resistance, he was one of the main figures of the freedom movements, being a undying defender of democracy, not being shy to show his support for the libertation and creation of the Federation, being one of it's founding members together with his brother.\n\nAt first Oscar supported his brother being the president, he honestly thought he would do a nice job and did believe his younger sibling when he said he truly believed in democracy, but recent times and events have made Oscar retract his support, specially with the more authoritarian methods employed by the president, now there exists this quiet rivalry between the two, with Oscar being ready to act if Amber further steps out of line."
SYM_Marco_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 35\n\nMarco is native to the region of Mavildea, being born in the city of Torizzo.\n\nHe would only spend a few years of his life within the occupied Federation, leaving at a pretty young age and moving to Hainosu in a clandestine way, there he would receive proper education, as well as military training, as the local government was deeply interested in the insect region freeing itself, he was a bit conflicted at the prospect of returning, but after some convincing by resistance groups he would return to fight in the freedom wars.\n\nMarco has no affiliations with any groups, he has no interest in creating them, he only wants to do his job, that is to serve the legitimate government of the Federation, he is deeply against any form of revolt."
SYM_Fyodr_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 32\n\nFyodr is native to the autonomous district of Zavikland, part of the Kakrikea region, he being born in the city of Zavikstown.\n\nFyodr always wanted to do something big in life, this is because beetles are rarely represented in the insect community, therefore he wanted to do something that would cause more attention towards his species, for this he decided to join his local resistance group, fighting alongside the wasps of Kakrikea and getting much of their respect, he always pushing himself forward as he felt pressured to do as good as he could, the pressure is still present even to this day to be something beetles can be proud of.\n\nFyodr has shown quite the interest towards the most progressive parts of the government, even having met some socialist leaderships within the nation, he would be more than happy to join any revolution to get rid of the shameful president."
SYM_Kallista_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 23\n\nKallista is native to and the governor of the region of Voskra, she was born in the city of Cochea.\n\nKallista is quite young compared to other generals and governors, and this surely isn't a surprise to anybody, after all she wasn't supposed to be in charge, she only got that occupation after the ant queen of Voskra mysteriously went missing, most have just assumed that Kallista has gotten rid of her after the fiasco that was the queen's handling of the region and her collaboration with the reptiles, now Kallista serves as the regent of the region as well as an appointed general of the Federation due to her important status and the fact she was a pretty high rank in the Voskran royal guard.\n\nKallista has no interest in the rest of the nation, she cares exclusively about her region and antkind, always defending her own species whenever she gets the chance, she has shown a slight interest in running in the elections, most likely so she can use that position to take revenge against the reptiles, she will most likely not join any revolts, as she doesn't want to weaken the country."
SYM_Abbas_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 39\n\nAbbas is not native to any region of the Federation, in fact he comes all the way from the east of the mountain range, from another insect nation that exists for much longer than the Federation ever did.\n\nAbbas moved into the Federation after the freedom wars already had concluded, his sole reason to be here is because he was ordered to aid the newly independent nation by his own country, the reason being that they approve of the idea of having more insect nations around the globe to fight against other species's influences, Abbas offers the Federation aid in desert warfare, as that is what he is accostumed to back home.\n\nAbbas doesn't care about the politics of the country, he only cares about the orders he was given, and that was to aid this nation in wathever way he could, so, of course he is automatically against any revolt or separatist movement, not wanting to see the Federation fall apart."
