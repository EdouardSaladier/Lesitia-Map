### LEADER DESC
SYM_Amber_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 45\n\nAmber was born in a small rural town once called "Vaselios", later the town would be renamed after him, getting the name "Ambersville", the grasshopper had a very humble and simple early life, his family being on the poor side of things, but still being able to afford a decent life, but there was a problem they faced quite often, that being the reptiles occupying the region, like in many other regions the occupiers were very cruel and destructive, and here was no different, with Amber's dad being killed when he was only 16, forcing him and his mom to make it on their own.\n\nDue to this experience the insect always opposed the Empire, for a few years he kept himself quiet so he wouldn't cause trouble to his mother, but after her passing he had nothing holding him back, he would show his hate towards the Empire by starting to unite many of the partisan and resistance movements in the region into a single more organised one due to his great speaches and promises, calling this united front the "Federal Force", on the years leading up to the nuclear conflict he would continue resisting, making the federal force larger and making sure they made the life of the reptiles of the south a living nightmare before what he calls the "Shining Miracle", which is the nukes, where he and his force were finally able to rise up and free themselves.\n\nBut one thing was clear, the united front wouldn't last very long, in fact it only lasted a few weeks before fracturing itself back into many small groups, the country had no trouble initially being formed, but now people were wondering why the nation needed to continue existing, many wanting their regions to be free like in the past instead of this artifical state, Amber's motives were brought up, a good part of the population accusing him of being power hungry due to his wish to continue the Federation, because of this he would become much more quiet, with his confidence getting lower every day, not being sure if he was still capable for the position of president, now only time will tell what is the end of his story."
SYM_Lua_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 36\n\nLuã was born in the city of Zentra, a bustling municipality in the Kakrikea region, of which Luã currently presides as governor. Ever since his childhood, Luã has resented the reptilians, a hatred that only grew in intensity as he aged. His youth was defined by a series of violent street brawls with the hated reptilian oppressors. He proved surprisingly competent in urban combat, able to take down opponents nearly two times his size with brutal efficiency. This lust for violence did not come without a cost, as Luã was plagued with both overconfidence and a dangerous recklessness in his youth. He failed just as often as he succeeded, suffering brutal beatdowns that left him bloody and scarred. However, his steadfast determination and proficiency attracted the attention of the local insectoid resistance, quickly securing him a role within the movement, and later leading to him gaining a leadership role in the insurrectionist army.\n\nDuring the wars of liberation, Luã was notably bloodthirsty, committing atrocities that stood out even among the unending bloodshed of the post-nuclear horror. No lizardfolk, be they man, woman or child, escaped his burning gaze. His style of command proved successful in this turbulent period, as he ruled with a firm but fair grip on the reins of power. This authoritarian method of ruling largely followed him into his tenure as governor, as he implemented a particularly autocratic rule over his domain. On one hand, he built hospitals, expanded welfare systems, and tried his hardest to improve the lot of the people; on the other, he punished any form of dissent with extremely harsh measures, often involving executions.\n\nLuã is currently very wary of the state of the world. His ultimate goal is to keep his people safe at any cost. He sees a strong federation as the greatest guarantor of security, particularly against the threat of a possible reptilian resurgence. However, he is increasingly concerned with the unstable nature of the federation in its current state. While he is willing to give the democratic system a chance to prove its strength, if any sort of deadlock forms he may be inspired to take up arms against the government and take the reins of power for himself."
SYM_Godofredo_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 54\n\nGodofredo is native to the region of Seda, born in the city of Beiramar.\n\nGodofredo was always a great planner with an eye for logistics, leading and planning many local revolts, also being the founder of many of the original resistance groups, helping bugs like Amber to get into power, he trained and commanded many of the generals serving the Federation and for that he was given the highest rank of the army.\n\nAs it seems Godofredo's tactics and ideas are a bit outdated, with a lot of generals commenting on it, causing him to not hold as much power as he once did in the academy and his influence is truly minimal over the others, due to this he is pretty bitter towards everyone, making so he will refuse to join any revolt or revolution just out of spite."
SYM_Alessandro_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 46\n\nAlessandro is native to the region of Mavildea, born in the city of Farend.\n\nAlessandro wasn't the most active resistance fighter, being mostly silent during the occupation and simply learning to live with it, until he saw the writing on the wall and decided to join one of the many resistance groups, there he showed himself as a decent planner and a even better defender, being great at preparing fortifications and barriers, as well as holding out for many days against incoming attacks.\n\nThe bee still isn't very active politically, he basically has the same mindset as he had on the past, seeing the Federation as just another country controlling his city, therefore he is pretty indifferent towards popular movements and will mostly just stick with the status quo."
SYM_Oscar_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 48\n\nOscar is native to the region of Zhafollis, born in the small rural town of Vaselios, now known as Ambersville.\n\nOscar is president Amber's older brother, during the occupation Oscar was much more active than Amber, being present in many of the popular revolts and major acts of resistance, he was one of the main figures of the freedom movements, being a undying defender of democracy, not being shy to show his support for the libertation and creation of the Federation, being one of it's founding members together with his brother.\n\nAt first Oscar supported his brother being the president, he honestly thought he would do a nice job and did believe his younger sibling when he said he truly believed in democracy, but recent times and events have made Oscar retract his support, specially with the more authoritarian methods employed by the president, now there exists this quiet rivalry between the two, with Oscar being ready to act if Amber further steps out of line."
SYM_Marco_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 35\n\nMarco is native to the region of Mavildea, being born in the city of Torizzo.\n\nHe would only spend a few years of his life within the occupied Federation, leaving at a pretty young age and moving to Hainosu in a clandestine way, there he would receive proper education, as well as military training, as the local government was deeply interested in the insect region freeing itself, he was a bit conflicted at the prospect of returning, but after some convincing by resistance groups he would return to fight in the freedom wars.\n\nMarco has no affiliations with any groups, he has no interest in creating them, he only wants to do his job, that is to serve the legitimate government of the Federation, he is deeply against any form of revolt."
SYM_Fyodr_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 32\n\nFyodr is native to the autonomous district of Zavikland, part of the Kakrikea region, he being born in the city of Zavikstown.\n\nFyodr always wanted to do something big in life, this is because beetles are rarely represented in the insect community, therefore he wanted to do something that would cause more attention towards his species, for this he decided to join his local resistance group, fighting alongside the wasps of Kakrikea and getting much of their respect, he always pushing himself forward as he felt pressured to do as good as he could, the pressure is still present even to this day to be something beetles can be proud of.\n\nFyodr has shown quite the interest towards the most progressive parts of the government, even having met some socialist leaderships within the nation, he would be more than happy to join any revolution to get rid of the shameful president."
SYM_Kallista_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 29\n\nKallista Sokolova is a military officer of the Symbiotic Federation currently serving as the governor and self proclaimed regent of the Voskra Provinces, having obtained her current status as a result of regicide. While a ruthless and ambitious individual, Kallista professes to act in the interest of all Voskran citizens, justifying her actions as necessary to unlock the true potential of antkind.\n\nBorn into the highly rigid and stratified society of the ants, as a child of the Queen Kallista should have been another faceless drone in the teeming sea of the great ant masses. However, the onset of global nuclear war and the collapse of the old Empires created a uniquely chaotic situation, one that thrust Kallista into the spotlight. As the world crumbled around them, Kallista rose to a position of leadership, commanding an small militia. With the eventual return of stability, Kallista was rewarded by promotion to a full general and integration into the professionalized military of the Voskran state. Her services during the immediate aftermath of the Nuclear exchange had made her into a paragon among both her people and the other insectoid species, creating the unique situation of an individual ant rising to something of a celebrity status.\n\nKallista saw the incorporation of the Voskran states into the greater Symbiotic Federation as a betrayal of her people. Through her military service she had been forged into a proud patriot, ever aware of the long past glories of the Voskran Empire, and a proud supporter of the colony system of life. With the ants now taking a subordinate role within a federation that proclaimed all it's members as equals, Kallista was determined to protect her peoples future, and took the drastic step of organizing a coup against the Queen; installing herself as regent.\n\nVoskra now exists in an uneasy state. Kallista has promised a return to greatness, but finds herself beset with the need to firmly cement her own power and improve the poor state of the Voskran nation at large. As such, she has been forced to instead stay within the relative safety and stability present within the large federation. But in Kallista’s mind these are temporary problems, and she remains confident of a future defined by the ever expanding colony of the Formicid peoples."
SYM_Abbas_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 39\n\nAbbas is not native to any region of the Federation, in fact he comes all the way from the east of the mountain range, from another insect nation that exists for much longer than the Federation ever did.\n\nAbbas moved into the Federation after the freedom wars already had concluded, his sole reason to be here is because he was ordered to aid the newly independent nation by his own country, the reason being that they approve of the idea of having more insect nations around the globe to fight against other species's influences, Abbas offers the Federation aid in desert warfare, as that is what he is accostumed to back home.\n\nAbbas doesn't care about the politics of the country, he only cares about the orders he was given, and that was to aid this nation in wathever way he could, so, of course he is automatically against any revolt or separatist movement, not wanting to see the Federation fall apart."

ZHA_robar_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 33\n\nA Moth of remarkable character, maybe the singular most known member of his species in the entire Symbiotic Federation. Robar Tevis is a strong proponent of democracy, well … the singular most loud-mouthed at least. More than one member of the autocratic faction of the Symbiotic Federation has felt the bite of his harrowing scolding and mockery, as he turns every public debate and local election into a fury of a screaming match between himself and his opponents. And not just that, as even the Social Media rings with his comments and sarcastic remarks. All in service to Democracy of course.\n\nMe knows more than many the bite of oppression of self-righteous dictatorial rulers. Bombs and civilians do not mix well, in fact they paint the walls more than often fully red. And if these murderers now take Insect Faces Tevis will rip out their mask and show the federation what small, evil and corrupt murders they truly are.\n\nRobar Tevis will not stand a Symbiotic Dictator. He will fight him with words, mockery and should it come to it guns."

TVA_tiveask_desc:0 "The Fog drives Insects insane. This is a well-known fact, witnessed by those brave or foolish enough to venture into the fog. Even the Governor of Tiveask left this place, forcing the Central Government to deal with this region, that seems to ever so massively be sprawling with bandits and insane people. Knowing full well that no-one in the army would ever volunteer for this region caused the Symbiotic Federation created the first independent armed guard of Tiveask. A force-formed guard of militias and low-lives that were gathered from the lowest of the Federations Armed forces. Failed officers, soldiers of second, third and fourth-rank quality. Drunkenness is high and they shoot at every shadow that moves around them. A well enough precaution, as the Federations most hostile region is home to enough dangers besides the fog that itself eats free insects every single day. To say that the Tiveask Guard run this Region is the wrong word, they hold their noise down and the horrors in. And in return will be ,for their lax discipline and lack of quality, not court-marshaled.\n\nYet as it stands, this force of rack-tack militias may very well be the only force standing between the fog and the rest of the Federation…"

SYM_the_current_situation:0 "The Current Situation"
SYM_the_current_situation_desc:0 "Just a few years ago, the soldiers of our liberation stood side-by-side as they fought for the right to rule their home! This is but a memory now, replaced with arguing and in-fighting in parliament, the streets and the nation itself. Every day there are reports of internal struggle, brutal assassinations, and separatists."
SYM_internal_report:0 "Internal Report"
SYM_internal_report_desc:0 "We are commmisioning the Federal Command to compile an internal report of our country on its political scene,economy and the state of the army. We have yet to commissioned one since gaining out freedom so considering the circumstances "
SYM_federal_party:0 "The Federal Party"
SYM_federal_party_desc:0 "The Federal Party is the strongest carrier of liberal unity and federal support out of all the parties.  Only the military itself has a stronger commitment to the Federation’s existence. Yet from a leadership perspective, this party is also one of the most divided, as several strong centres of leadership exist within it."
SYM_secure_donations:0 "Secure Donations"
SYM_secure_donations_desc:0 "A big problem for the Federal Party is the lack of funding. With little state support and inefficient messaging towards the public, the Federal Party ran into a deficit. We need to aquire donations in the form of loans from the central bank, a mix of secret funds put aside for public security, diverted army payments and genuine donations. "
SYM_reachout_to_socialists:0 "Approach the Socialists"
SYM_reachout_to_socialists_desc:0 "Inside the Empire left-wing Collectivism was the most brutally suppressed and persecuted. This made it an attractive choice as an ideology for many rebel groups in their fight against the Empire. And truth is, the socialist militias and left-wing combatants want the federation to succeed, even if it is in a far more Collectivist vision than it is today."
SYM_trinket_reforms:0 "Trinket Regulations"
SYM_trinket_reforms_desc:0 "Generally, the socialists want to rebuild society, some more radical than others, but all want change from the current post-imperial status quo. This can not be done in the time we have before the elections and politically speaking not by us. We can however grant some measures to relieve the lower civilian strata of some of their burden."
SYM_meet_with_governors:0 "Meet With the Governors" 
SYM_meet_with_governors_desc:0 "Many Governors of the many Regions of the Federation were never appointed by the central government nor voted upon by the Insects of the Regions themselves. Instead put themselves into positions of power by the merit of their arms and armies, as almost all of them were former rebel group leaders and Liberation War Veterans. They are armed, fierce and independent-minded."
SYM_putdown_revolts:0 "Put Down Revolts"
SYM_putdown_revolts_desc:0 "As expected, many Governors used the stage of the Federal Meeting to voice their grievances against the central capital. Words that sparked acts of rebellion amongst many ethnic and ideological groups of the nation. These fighters are often times directly or indirectly connected with the leaders of their faction, others fight on their own will and just follow the chaos."
SYM_3376_elections:0 "The 3376 Election"
SYM_3376_elections_desc:0 "Chaos. The Election will mean chaos, one way or the other. The Governors and Separatists will claim that it was rigged if they don’t win and cry against the victory of any one of them if they do. The army is getting nervous too and has already moved several of its most loyal units to deployment areas and strategically important sections around the Capitol itself. They had no orders to do this but also no order to stop now."
SYM_the_candis:0 "The Candidates"
SYM_the_candis_desc:0 "Stopping the election would be madness. Worse yet, it would give the Governors, the rebels and the terrorist groups all the anti-federal ammunition they need to declare war against us. Denying this election even for the sensible reasons of internal struggle means depriving our people of the right to choose. A right they had been denied for a hundred years. A right they have fought for. The Federation is not lost yet and its people know oppression and pain all too well. We cannot and WILL NOT allow the Federation’s dream to die just by action out of fear. The Election will come and its candidates will stand the trial of the nation. One of them will win or all of them will lose."
SYM_not_ready:0 "Delay the Elections"
SYM_not_ready_desc:0 "There is no choice, there can be none. The Election threatens the Federation as a nation, it CANNOT proceed without blowing the whole thing apart in an orgy of violence that will make the Liberation War look peaceful and organized in comparison. We cannot take this risk, we cannot allow the nation to destroy itself. We have to fix things first, even if it means an absolute overreach of current presidential authority over the different regions and nations inside the Federation. The Election will be delayed to whatever timeframe we see fit to be most appropriate. A time where we can ensure that no rebellion, attack or dictatorship can rise out of an election that is meant to give the people freedom most of all!"

SYM.34.d:0 "A nation isn’t born out of nothing, it’s forged out of a shared culture, history and kinship of its people and ours isn’t much different save for one thing, a history of pain and suffering.\nBefore the occupation by Glaurungir we didn’t have a unified government that ruled over a nation of all Insectkind, just mere tribes and micronations infighting with eachother at every opportunity and as such conflict and war were commonplace. It was a world of its own complexity and an unusual balance. \nHowever, that all changed one day when the Empire came and burned it all down and began to rule our lands with an iron fist and scorching hate which lasted for a hundred years. Our disunited nations and tribes of insects were no match for the unified legions of the Empire and as such one by one they fell and were turned into oceans of dead chitin, with some estimating that for each year of the Imperial rule a million of our kind were killed. It wasn’t until the fires of the Empire’s own hate burnt itself inside out and paved way for the “Freedom Rebellion” that we severed the lands of the Insectkind from its power and we forged the nation that we now call the Symbiotic Federation. A project of hope and final unity for our kind. Should the Federation hold strong together and stay united we may yet cast off the shadow the Empire cast on us.\nYet the weight of these events and pain they brought is a wound on the young Federation’s soul which is yet to heal. This weight lies heavy on every insect in our nation, however it may lie the heaviest on the shoulders of our president Amber. He’s the center of the Federation and as such he is tasked with holding our fragile and violent federation together and united. However he is not the first to take office and his predecessor, Equis Tritio already broke under the pressure of the weight that’s exerted on the office of the president and Amber holds only half his popularity or political skills.\nDespite all the opposition President Amber may be yet the only pillar of the Federation that can hold back the chaos of political violence until our federation can fully embrace the ideals of Democracy.\nHowever should he fail, our nation will no doubt soon follow. And Insectkind will burn once more in the shadow of the Empire... "

SYM.36.t:0 "Internal Report: Economy"
SYM.36.d:0 "Sub-section A: The State Of The Economy\n\nUnlike most nations, the economy of the Symbiotic is not one of self-reliance nor is it developed in any way. During the occupation the Glaurungir occupation authority has implemented a system of resource and labor exploitation that still has effects on the current day economy of the SF. This issue was deepened by the destruction wrought by the rebellion that set us free and enabled us to pursue a more self-sufficient economy. At this moment things like public services, access streets, nationwide roads and general infrastructure are often severely lacking or nonexistent. By effect of this we are seeing a growth in unemployment in the nation as well as economic inefficiencies. Unless we are able to rectify this situation, we are bound to see a steady rise in opposition against the government and an increase in support for decentralized rule or even secession."

SYM.37.t:0 "Internal Report: Politics"
SYM.37.d:0 "Sub-section B: The Political Situation\n\nThe Symbiotic federation is much less a unified state but rather more a collective of many regions and hives united under one banner with one common goal: defense against Glaurungir. The promise was that should the threat pass, the federation would dissolve back into independent hives, and now with Glaurungir being at its weakest there have been questions going around the collective wondering whether the threat has indeed passed. Many regions displeased with the current government debate that yes, however there are those who still see the threat in the remnants of the colonial rule holding out in the warlord state of Rheol. Many people hold more loyalty to their region than to the federation and in turn regions believe in their own sovereignty more than in the ideals of the federation. Should the federal state anger any of the regions through their actions they will likely secede without a second thought. Careful actions will need to be undertaken to avoid radicalizing elements of the state that we rely on for defense."

SYM.38.t:0 "Internal Report: Army"
SYM.38.d:0 "Sub-section C: The State Of The Army\n\nThe armed forces of the federation are made up of mainly ex-militia and ex-resistance forces from the occupation days. To this day the affairs of the army are handled on the regional level including pay and training. As such there doesn’t exist a unified regiment structure or doctrine that serves as a guide for our armed forces. Another consequence of this style of management is the high regional connections between different commanders making their loyalty dubious in case of relations becoming tense between the federal state and the respective region. However, there is one universal belief shared between every commander within our army. And that is of belief in democracy, many of our generals and field marshals are soldiers who have spent their lives fighting against the oppression of the dictatorial rule of the colonial administration of Glaurungir. Should the federal state ever betray the ideals of democracy it may find itself in a position where a disloyal army might attempt to depose the would-be authoritarian figure. This is of the essence, especially now with the quickly approaching election which is causing tensions to rise between ethnic as well as ideological groups. The reports of planned rebellions and secessions are just the beginnings of threats that the state will have to deal with in the upcoming elections."
