### LEADER DESC
SYM_Amber_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 45\n\nAmber was born in a small rural town once called "Vaselios", later the town would be renamed after him, getting the name "Ambersville", the grasshopper had a very humble and simple early life, his family being on the poor side of things, but still being able to afford a decent life, but there was a problem they faced quite often, that being the reptiles occupying the region, like in many other regions the occupiers were very cruel and destructive, and here was no different, with Amber's dad being killed when he was only 16, forcing him and his mom to make it on their own.\n\nDue to this experience the insect always opposed the Empire, for a few years he kept himself quiet so he wouldn't cause trouble to his mother, but after her passing he had nothing holding him back, he would show his hate towards the Empire by starting to unite many of the partisan and resistance movements in the region into a single more organised one due to his great speaches and promises, calling this united front the "Federal Force", on the years leading up to the nuclear conflict he would continue resisting, making the federal force larger and making sure they made the life of the reptiles of the south a living nightmare before what he calls the "Shining Miracle", which is the nukes, where he and his force were finally able to rise up and free themselves.\n\nBut one thing was clear, the united front wouldn't last very long, in fact it only lasted a few weeks before fracturing itself back into many small groups, the country had no trouble initially being formed, but now people were wondering why the nation needed to continue existing, many wanting their regions to be free like in the past instead of this artifical state, Amber's motives were brought up, a good part of the population accusing him of being power hungry due to his wish to continue the Federation, because of this he would become much more quiet, with his confidence getting lower every day, not being sure if he was still capable for the position of president, now only time will tell what is the end of his story."
SYM_Lua_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 36\n\nLuã was born in the city of Zentra, a bustling municipality in the Kakrikea region, of which Luã currently presides as governor. Ever since his childhood, Luã has resented the reptilians, a hatred that only grew in intensity as he aged. His youth was defined by a series of violent street brawls with the hated reptilian oppressors. He proved surprisingly competent in urban combat, able to take down opponents nearly two times his size with brutal efficiency. This lust for violence did not come without a cost, as Luã was plagued with both overconfidence and a dangerous recklessness in his youth. He failed just as often as he succeeded, suffering brutal beatdowns that left him bloody and scarred. However, his steadfast determination and proficiency attracted the attention of the local insectoid resistance, quickly securing him a role within the movement, and later leading to him gaining a leadership role in the insurrectionist army.\n\nDuring the wars of liberation, Luã was notably bloodthirsty, committing atrocities that stood out even among the unending bloodshed of the post-nuclear horror. No lizardfolk, be they man, woman or child, escaped his burning gaze. His style of command proved successful in this turbulent period, as he ruled with a firm but fair grip on the reins of power. This authoritarian method of ruling largely followed him into his tenure as governor, as he implemented a particularly autocratic rule over his domain. On one hand, he built hospitals, expanded welfare systems, and tried his hardest to improve the lot of the people; on the other, he punished any form of dissent with extremely harsh measures, often involving executions.\n\nLuã is currently very wary of the state of the world. His ultimate goal is to keep his people safe at any cost. He sees a strong federation as the greatest guarantor of security, particularly against the threat of a possible reptilian resurgence. However, he is increasingly concerned with the unstable nature of the federation in its current state. While he is willing to give the democratic system a chance to prove its strength, if any sort of deadlock forms he may be inspired to take up arms against the government and take the reins of power for himself."
SYM_Godofredo_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 54\n\nGodofredo is native to the region of Seda, born in the city of Beiramar.\n\nGodofredo was always a great planner with an eye for logistics, leading and planning many local revolts, also being the founder of many of the original resistance groups, helping bugs like Amber to get into power, he trained and commanded many of the generals serving the Federation and for that he was given the highest rank of the army.\n\nAs it seems Godofredo's tactics and ideas are a bit outdated, with a lot of generals commenting on it, causing him to not hold as much power as he once did in the academy and his influence is truly minimal over the others, due to this he is pretty bitter towards everyone, making so he will refuse to join any revolt or revolution just out of spite."
SYM_Alessandro_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 46\n\nAlessandro is native to the region of Mavildea, born in the city of Farend.\n\nAlessandro wasn't the most active resistance fighter, being mostly silent during the occupation and simply learning to live with it, until he saw the writing on the wall and decided to join one of the many resistance groups, there he showed himself as a decent planner and a even better defender, being great at preparing fortifications and barriers, as well as holding out for many days against incoming attacks.\n\nThe bee still isn't very active politically, he basically has the same mindset as he had on the past, seeing the Federation as just another country controlling his city, therefore he is pretty indifferent towards popular movements and will mostly just stick with the status quo."
SYM_Oscar_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 48\n\nOscar is native to the region of Zhafollis, born in the small rural town of Vaselios, now known as Ambersville.\n\nOscar is president Amber's older brother, during the occupation Oscar was much more active than Amber, being present in many of the popular revolts and major acts of resistance, he was one of the main figures of the freedom movements, being a undying defender of democracy, not being shy to show his support for the libertation and creation of the Federation, being one of it's founding members together with his brother.\n\nAt first Oscar supported his brother being the president, he honestly thought he would do a nice job and did believe his younger sibling when he said he truly believed in democracy, but recent times and events have made Oscar retract his support, specially with the more authoritarian methods employed by the president, now there exists this quiet rivalry between the two, with Oscar being ready to act if Amber further steps out of line."
SYM_Marco_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 35\n\nMarco is native to the region of Mavildea, being born in the city of Torizzo.\n\nHe would only spend a few years of his life within the occupied Federation, leaving at a pretty young age and moving to Hainosu in a clandestine way, there he would receive proper education, as well as military training, as the local government was deeply interested in the insect region freeing itself, he was a bit conflicted at the prospect of returning, but after some convincing by resistance groups he would return to fight in the freedom wars.\n\nMarco has no affiliations with any groups, he has no interest in creating them, he only wants to do his job, that is to serve the legitimate government of the Federation, he is deeply against any form of revolt."
SYM_Fyodr_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 32\n\nFyodr is native to the autonomous district of Zavikland, part of the Kakrikea region, he being born in the city of Zavikstown.\n\nFyodr always wanted to do something big in life, this is because beetles are rarely represented in the insect community, therefore he wanted to do something that would cause more attention towards his species, for this he decided to join his local resistance group, fighting alongside the wasps of Kakrikea and getting much of their respect, he always pushing himself forward as he felt pressured to do as good as he could, the pressure is still present even to this day to be something beetles can be proud of.\n\nFyodr has shown quite the interest towards the most progressive parts of the government, even having met some socialist leaderships within the nation, he would be more than happy to join any revolution to get rid of the shameful president."
SYM_Kallista_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 29\n\nKallista Sokolova is a military officer of the Symbiotic Federation currently serving as the governor and self proclaimed regent of the Voskra Provinces, having obtained her current status as a result of regicide. While a ruthless and ambitious individual, Kallista professes to act in the interest of all Voskran citizens, justifying her actions as necessary to unlock the true potential of antkind.\n\nBorn into the highly rigid and stratified society of the ants, as a child of the Queen Kallista should have been another faceless drone in the teeming sea of the great ant masses. However, the onset of global nuclear war and the collapse of the old Empires created a uniquely chaotic situation, one that thrust Kallista into the spotlight. As the world crumbled around them, Kallista rose to a position of leadership, commanding an small militia. With the eventual return of stability, Kallista was rewarded by promotion to a full general and integration into the professionalized military of the Voskran state. Her services during the immediate aftermath of the Nuclear exchange had made her into a paragon among both her people and the other insectoid species, creating the unique situation of an individual ant rising to something of a celebrity status.\n\nKallista saw the incorporation of the Voskran states into the greater Symbiotic Federation as a betrayal of her people. Through her military service she had been forged into a proud patriot, ever aware of the long past glories of the Voskran Empire, and a proud supporter of the colony system of life. With the ants now taking a subordinate role within a federation that proclaimed all it's members as equals, Kallista was determined to protect her peoples future, and took the drastic step of organizing a coup against the Queen; installing herself as regent.\n\nVoskra now exists in an uneasy state. Kallista has promised a return to greatness, but finds herself beset with the need to firmly cement her own power and improve the poor state of the Voskran nation at large. As such, she has been forced to instead stay within the relative safety and stability present within the large federation. But in Kallista’s mind these are temporary problems, and she remains confident of a future defined by the ever expanding colony of the Formicid peoples."
SYM_Abbas_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 39\n\nAbbas is not native to any region of the Federation, in fact he comes all the way from the east of the mountain range, from another insect nation that exists for much longer than the Federation ever did.\n\nAbbas moved into the Federation after the freedom wars already had concluded, his sole reason to be here is because he was ordered to aid the newly independent nation by his own country, the reason being that they approve of the idea of having more insect nations around the globe to fight against other species's influences, Abbas offers the Federation aid in desert warfare, as that is what he is accostumed to back home.\n\nAbbas doesn't care about the politics of the country, he only cares about the orders he was given, and that was to aid this nation in wathever way he could, so, of course he is automatically against any revolt or separatist movement, not wanting to see the Federation fall apart."
