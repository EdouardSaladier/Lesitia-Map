 d1_s1_l0:0 "§1Laomann IlleBhàin§!, the head of the §0Arbitration Commission§!, sat in his office in the center of the city, his brow furrowed in concern. His advisor, Fearghas Sheathnaich, had just entered the room and sat across from him at the large wooden desk."
 d1_s1_l1:0 "Good morning, §4Sheathnaich§!. I am troubled by the recent rise of the §GAiseirigh movement§! and the §OSecularist Industrialists§!"
 d1_s1_l2:0 "Their growing influence threatens to undermine the power of the §0Arbitration Commission§! and our ability to maintain order in the country"
 d1_s1_l3:0 "I share your concerns, §1Arbiter IlleBhàin§!. This situation is far from ideal, and we need to act quickly if we want to prevent it from spiraling out of control. Fortunately, we still have options available to us to ensure that the Commission remains in power"
 d1_s1_l4:0 "What would be these options and your recommended course of action?"
 d1_s1_l5:0 "We have three options, and each of them has its risks and benefits. We can support the §OSecularists§!, use the §GAiseirigh movement§! to our advantage, or try to find a common ground between the moderate factions."
 d1_s1_l6:0 "I believe that the most effective option would be to use the §GAiseirigh movement§! to our advantage. They are already gaining popularity, and if we can sway them to our side, we may be able to eliminate the §OSecularist§! threat as well."
 d1_s1_l7:0 "Afterwards, once we no longer have any use for them, we simply can have them all arrested by the Public Security Commission."
 d1_s1_l8:0 "That is certainly a possibility. But we must be careful not to let the §GAiseirigh§! gain too much power, or else arresting them will no longer be an option"
 d1_s1_l9:0 "Yes, Arbiter, we must tread carefully. But I believe that with the right strategy, we can use the §GAiseirigh§! to our advantage without risking too much."
 d1_s1_l10:0 "What about the Security Commission? Can we rely on them to help us?"
 d1_s1_l11:0 "I'm not sure. We can bring back Iomarach and let him do what he does best – maintain public security, but he is a very dangerous man. If we bring him back, we must make sure not to anger him, or we risk losing control of the situation completely."
 d1_s1_l12:0 "I see. Perhaps we should establish an oversight committee to keep the Security Commission in check."
 d1_s1_l13:0 "While this is a possibility, it would make the Security Commission less effective when we need it the most."
 d1_s1_l14:0 "And what about the §OSecularists§!?"
 d1_s1_l15:0 "We could ally with the §OSecularist Industrialists§! and use their influence over the medias to get rid of the §GAiseirigh movement§!"
 d1_s1_l16:0 "But that would mean giving up some of our religious values, as the industrialists want the abrogation of the religious hiring obligations."
 d1_s1_l17:0 "Needless to say, such a move would be very unpopular within the population, as well as within our own administration"
 d1_s1_l18:0 "IlleBhàin took a deep sigh, and paused a moment before continuing"
 d1_s1_l19:0 "And what if we tell them to fuck off once we've dealt with the §GAiseirigh§!?"
 d1_s1_l20:0 "Most industrialists will stay loyal if we give some concessions to the private sectors, and we can convince them afterwards to abandon the §OSecularists§!. Or we can just ignore them afterwards, but we'll be targeted by the medias for a while."
 d1_s1_l21:0 "Alright. Thank you for your report §4Sheathnaich§!. For now, we should focus on gathering intelligence and keeping the country stable. I will also speak to the other members of the Arbitration Commission to get their input. We will reconvene in a few days to discuss our next steps."
