### LEADER DESC
AKU_trade_prince_council_desc:0 "The Trade Prince Council was created as a temporary government composed of the nation’s richest business foxes in the wake of their war of independence against Glaurungir. However, this bandaid government was not replaced after the war as these elites did not want to give up their power. As time went on, the council has failed to create any sort of progress as a governing body and has only enabled laws that protected their short term interests. With each passing day, it becomes more and more evident that the Trade Prince Council must be massively reformed or replaced entirely."
