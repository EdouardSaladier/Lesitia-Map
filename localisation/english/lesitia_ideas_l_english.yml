 voskra_colony:0 "Voskra Colony System"
 voskra_colony_desc:0 "The ants of Voskra operate in a pretty unique way, liking to live by the steps of ants of old, the idea of individualism is heavily frowned upon, instead having a focus on communal activities and common goals, everything belonging to the colony, with concepts like private property and currency being completely abolished, so a true united colony can form; it does not come as a surprise that other regions non-core to the ants of Voskra might be against this system and heavily resist it."
 sister_republics:0 "Sister Republics"
 sister_republics_desc:0 "The Federation and Borca have historically been aligned for centuries, from the medieval era to the occupation times, with both countries revolting at the same time as a sign of solidarity and support for the democratic ideals, both have been deepening their ties and economic deals, so much so that the two nations can feel the benefits of their partnership, both in the economic and political fields, and even in military matters as the armies learn from each other."
 symbiotic_army:0 "Army of the Federation"
 symbiotic_army_desc:0 "The army of the Federation is known to be one of the best of post-occupation Archea, being one of the most elite trained and well-behaved, but with all positives comes a negative, due to the glorified image that the army has on the eyes of the public, and due to their members holding many important positions in the government it means they control quite a bit of what goes on, and sometimes their personal disagreements spill into the national unity of the country, let alone when they attempt to change laws or candidates they don't like."
 chaotic_existence:0 "Chaotic Existence"
 chaotic_existence_desc:0 "The Federation isn't exactly a stable state, everyone on the continent knows it, this being mostly because of the artificial patchwork nature of the state due to the revolt roots, nationwide poverty, hunger, unemployment, broken promises about separation, conflicting identities and widly different beliefs, due to the diversty of it's realm it is almost impossible to keep everyone happy and to keep everything together, letting to the rise of extremism and disunity."
 regionalism_problem:0 "Strong Regionalism"
 regionalism_problem_desc:0 "As part of the treaties signed to form the nation the ex-insect states demanded high autonomy and low central government control, to the point they acted like a separate sovereign state, Amber seeing that his hand were tied ended up agreeing on these terms as long as the Symbiotic Federation existed, another term of the agreements was that the S.F would dissolve itself after the main threat of the occupation had been dealt it, this promise, however, was not followed through."
 emergency_assistance:0 "The E.P.R.A"

 refugee_state:0 "Neutral Refugee Zone"
 refugee_state_desc:0 "The Tiveask Provisional Government was set up with the single goal of protecting the escaping refugees of the Symbiotic civil collapse, the leader, Meloe, even said so himself, wanting to minimize the civilian deaths of this conflict, even allowing soldiers who do not want to fight anymore to seek safety inside the borders of the nation, who labels itself a neutral zone; but there is a problem that relates to this choice, that being the general instability it causes, together with the fact due to the nature of the state nobody wants or supports a war of conquest."
 ressian_machine:0 "Ressian National Ideal"

 lavido_democracy:0 "Unique Democracy"
 lavido_democracy_desc:0 "The democracy of Lavido is found nowhere else within the old Federal territories, being a mix between socialist and liberal principles tied neatly together in a single package, this system allowed Lavido to pass many work and social reforms while at the same time not impacting it's internal stability, that was until the region received control of the rural areas to the north, ever since that day there has been this growing divide between those who wanted democracy to stay (in the South) and those who wanted Lavido to become a true revolutionary country (in the North), this would ultimately cause the north, specially because of the lackluster handling of the mechanization issue, to revolt and form their own state, the United Hives of Lavido, the government in Proglio still hasn't recognized them and is desperately trying to keep the realm and the ideology together."
 revolutionary_revolt:0 "Vanguard Revolutionary Revolt"
 revolutionary_revolt_desc:0 "it's a well known fact that the United Hives revolted from the central Lavidoan government over their handling of the mechanization issue, but it isn't the only ideals and reasonings that the people of north Lavido had when joining the revolt, it goes much deeper then just than that one question, one of the main goals of the UHL is to form a true revolutionary state, they liked the fact Lavido was somewhat socialist inclined, but they simply thought that the country wasn't going far enough to fix the issues of society, therefore they had to take up arms to do what was right, part of the government operation of the United Hives is now to purge any democratic remains and instead focus on the vanguardist purity of the ideology."
