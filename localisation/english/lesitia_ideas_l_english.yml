 symbiotic_army:0 "Army of the Federation"
 symbiotic_army_desc:0 "The army of the Federation is known to be one of the best of post-occupation Archea, being one of the most elite trained and well-behaved, but with all positives comes a negative, due to the glorified image that the army has on the eyes of the public, and due to their members holding many important positions in the government it means they control quite a bit of what goes on, and sometimes their personal disagreements spill into the national unity of the country, let alone when they attempt to change laws or candidates they don't like."
 chaotic_existence:0 "Chaotic Existence"
 chaotic_existence_desc:0 "The Federation isn't exactly a stable state, everyone on the continent knows it, this being mostly because of the artificial patchwork nature of the state due to the revolt roots, nationwide poverty, hunger, unemployment, broken promises about separation, conflicting identities and widly different beliefs, due to the diversty of it's realm it is almost impossible to keep everyone happy and to keep everything together, letting to the rise of extremism and disunity."

 lavido_democracy:0 "Unique Democracy"
 lavido_democracy_desc:0 "The democracy of Lavido is found nowhere else within the old Federal territories, being a mix between socialist and liberal principles tied neatly together in a single package, this system allowed Lavido to pass many work and social reforms while at the same time not impacting it's internal stability, that was until the region received control of the rural areas to the north, ever since that day there has been this growing divide between those who wanted democracy to stay (in the South) and those who wanted Lavido to become a true revolutionary country (in the North), this would ultimately cause the north, specially because of the lackluster handling of the mechanization issue, to revolt and form their own state, the United Hives of Lavido, the government in Proglio still hasn't recognized them and is desperately trying to keep the realm and the ideology together."
 revolutionary_revolt:0 "Vanguard Revolutionary Revolt"
 revolutionary_revolt_desc:0 "it's a well known fact that the United Hives revolted from the central Lavidoan government over their handling of the mechanization issue, but it isn't the only ideals and reasonings that the people of north Lavido had when joining the revolt, it goes much deeper then just than that one question, one of the main goals of the UHL is to form a true revolutionary state, they liked the fact Lavido was somewhat socialist inclined, but they simply thought that the country wasn't going far enough to fix the issues of society, therefore they had to take up arms to do what was right, part of the government operation of the United Hives is now to purge any democratic remains and instead focus on the vanguardist purity of the ideology."
 termite_future:0 "Cult of Tomorrow"
 termite_future_desc:0 "Termite society operates in a very peculiar way, a way which puts emphasis in progress and the day of tomorrow, those inside the mound are not taught about their history, since the rulership sees it as irrelevant and retrogading, instead they focus education towards the pursuit of advancement, or at least the idealized version of progress, every termite strives to be the one to coin a new invention or to help the mound in any way they might be able to."
 outsider_issue:0 "Xenophobic Rethoric"
 outsider_issue_desc:0 "The termites have a well known reputation about not liking any outsiders from the mound, specially those of different species, let alone those who aren't insects altogether, this bleeds thru to their governance over the surface's dwellers, they have no interest in working with any of them, making occupying and controlling extra territory almost impossible unless some new course of action is taken, with the sole reason the termites even left their mound in the first place being to secure the area around it, making sure no one else ever controls it."
 tiveask_fog:0 "Nevzgody Fog"
 tiveask_fog_desc:0 "The Nevzgody Fog/Misery Fog or even Tiveask Fog is the main characteristic of the Tiveask area, a thick dark mist that covers all areas of the region, making life miserable and degrading, also known to cause many health problems and diseases, some parts of it even being radioactive, nobody really knows the origin, but some suggest the heavy industry, brought over by the reptiles, that used to occupy the region, caused the phenomenon, even after they have been removed the problem still hasn't been resolved, some cities and specific buildings are able to escape the sickly fog with the use of special fog condensers, a technology that was used to protect Zhafollis from the issue, but few can really afford it, specially the small groups of survivors within the region."
 tiveask_bandits:0 "Tiveask Bandits"
 tiveask_bandits_desc:0 "Tiveask always had a big bandit problem, even back on the day of occupation due to the lawless nature of the region and the lack of proper law authority in the area, this wouldn't change under the Federation, with the bandits being able to escape persecution due to the ineptitude of the S.F, this problem would only grow as the fog started appearing, now the criminals having a perfect place to hide, making Tiveask the bandit and mercenary capital of the continent."

 ruthless_rule:0 "Ruthless Rule"
 ruthless_rule_desc:0 "The Bandits of Tiveask aren't interested in making any friendships with the civilians, instead they apply their proven strategy to control them, that being the concept of fear and terror, by making the civilians terrified to revolt it is inevitable that they will be more controllable and submissive, if any of them get out of line the most gruesome punishment awaits them, creating a sense of dread and hopelessness, as there is nobody to help them."
 ephemeral_militia:0 "Ephemeral Militia"
 ephemeral_militia_desc:0 "The Ephemeral Militia operates much like any other gang to an extent, demanding tribute and money from other groups, nations and inhabitants of the region, but where they differ is the fact that they force civilians to serve under their gang as a recruit at some point of their lifes, gaslighting them into thinking that the bandit life is the best one there is, and at the end of process make this new recruit into a member of the militia, this militia being heavily armed and known to be very effective compared to other gang militias."
