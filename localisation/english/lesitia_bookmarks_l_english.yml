 SYM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Symbiotic Federation is the result of years of political work led by current President Amber Azkrini toward the unification of the numerous nation-states of the region.\n\nAmber mainly found support among the lower classes through the development of national healthcare and work code reforms.\n\nThe collapse of the neighboring superpowers fragilized the very foundations of the Federation, being the protection of the region against foreign powers."
 AKU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Throughout the sands of time, The Fennec Foxes of Akuriel have a reputation for being deceitful and greedy, known for their successful merchants.

With a temporary patchwork government funded by Akuriel's elites, led by the Trade Prince Council, a group plagued by internal conflicts. The people are now calling for change, will the nation hold itself together, or will it shatter and fade into the sands?." 
 VRT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Vratenzk is quite the anomaly of a nation, not having existed in any capacity or idea, only being created in recent times due to specific happenings that naturally cascaded into the formation of the state.\n\nThe Symbiotic Federation used to own the area, but due to poor management the region would break free and form its own nation, a hostile one.\n\nNow the country sees itself as a supremacist populist dictatorship led by the wasp Vera Triansbuer, who is attemping to form a brand new national identity and goal."
 AVN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Avenska is one of the oldest nations of the region, having existed before any modern insect state in the whole world, it fought bravely against the foreign reptilian invaders, holding out for years, but it couldn’t hold on forever.\n\nThe nation was somewhat lucky, due to the fact the invaders were quite friendly to the mantids, meaning they got to keep and preserve most of their culture.\n\nWith the newly gained freedom the nation is ruled with a light hand, the dictator Pyotr Kavinse being very lenient."
 REZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Rezhenevez is what one would call an “Artificial State”, it has no major connections to the lands it occupies, and if it did it was well over a century ago, the only thing that most inhabitants share is their rodent roots.\n\nThe ones leading the nation were once enslaved labor brought over to the west, made to work on the roach region of Eth.\n\nThe leader Alban Briz is quite obsessed over Eth’s culture and traditions and wishes to transform the region into something similar, but the locals don’t seem that thrilled."
 REO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Rheol was once one on the the centers of the Empires power, a massively industrialized imperial province with trade, harbors and economical growth surpassed only by the Empires other core regions. From Rheol ruled the Empire the south and the riches of the Southern Lands flowed into Glaurungir again. The fires of nuclear war turned Glaurungirs splendor into ash. Millions died, but millions more lived only to suffer the brutality of the post-apocalypse. For Rheol to rise again it needs not only a strong center, but also the resources of Glaurungir and its colonies."
