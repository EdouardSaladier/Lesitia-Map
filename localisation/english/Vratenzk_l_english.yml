### LEADER DESC
VRT_vera_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 36\n\nVera Triansbuer's rulership is quite the puzzling one, everyone outside the country knows that she is a devout supremacist with deep hatred towards many groups and identities, but, inside Vratenzk, she seems to not be hated by many, even those theoretically on her hit-list, being difficult to explain why she had such respect from her people in the first place, her modus operandi being quite sophisticated.\n\nHer way of ruling is quite different from most supremacists, not because she is any nicer or saner, but because she knows how to hide it way better, she built herself a image of being the "Mother of the Nation" and a "Staunch Defender of Democracy", this being accomplished with charity programs and by never using the word supremacy directly, but instead doing everything in the name of "democracy", many have coined this way of leading as "Neo-Supremacy", where the supremacist pretends to have other goals, even working together with democrats, while achieving his real goals in secret.\n\nHer past is not known, the information being really limited, the only thing of her past that is known is that she led the revolt against the Symbiotic Federation, leading to the independence of Vratenzk, this fact being used by her many times in propaganda."
VRT_Vera2_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 36\n\nVera's leadership as a commander is the same one as a ruler, she is a ruthless no-compromise wasp who is very hard to please, not a single soldier within Vratenzk wishes to be under her command, as she punishes any minute flaw, with death being a very common punishment, so much so sometimes she is nicknamed the "Death Commander", but that does mean her army is one of the most loyal elite ones there are."
VRT_Makno_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 40\n\nMakno was born in Viasgorod, the capital of Vratenzk, he was very diconnected from his family and local community, instead he preferred to spend his times reading books and manuals in the local library, with military tactics being amongst his favorites, so much so that when the country got it's freedom he was given the position of commander, due to his advanced knowledge that few wasps could even rival."
VRT_Matthiv_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 53\n\nMatthiv isn't from the continent, he was born in far away lands, from what he says (which isn't much), he is from the western continent, from a small country that is barely mentioned anywhere else, he refuses to say the name, saying that he never really cared about his "homeland" and instead always cared about making a life for himself, and one of the ways he found success was to offer mercenary services to the locals, in a few years he would be seen as the most fierce fighter from his lands.\n\nAfter the collapse of the reptile empire Matthiv would make his way to the east, wanting to find personal glory for himself, to make his name more known for potential employers, he would participate in many fights and battles during the freedom wars, fighting for all sides that could hire him and doing anything he wanted, not caring about local laws, now he is being hired by the Vratenzkian state as a commander, a controversial choice that led to many nations denouncing the hiring."
