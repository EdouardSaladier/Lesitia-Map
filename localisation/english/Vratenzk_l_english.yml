### LEADER DESC
VRT_vera_desc:0 "Age: 36\n\nVera Triansbuer's rulership is quite the puzzling one, everyone outside the country knows that she is a devout supremacist with deep hatred towards many groups and identities, but, inside Vratenzk, she seems to not be hated by many, even those theoretically on her hit-list, being difficult to explain why she had such respect from her people in the first place, her modus operandi being quite sophisticated.\n\nHer way of ruling is quite different from most supremacists, not because she is any nicer or saner, but because she knows how to hide it way better, she built herself a image of being the "Mother of the Nation" and a "Staunch Defender of Democracy", this being accomplished with charity programs and by never using the word supremacy directly, but instead doing everything in the name of "democracy", many have coined this way of leading as "Neo-Supremacy", where the supremacist pretends to have other goals, even working together with democrats, while achieving his real goals in secret.\n\nHer past is not known, the information being really limited, the only thing of her past that is known is that she led the revolt against the Symbiotic Federation, leading to the independence of Vratenzk, this fact being used by her many times in propaganda."
