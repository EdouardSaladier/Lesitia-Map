### LEADER DESC
VRT_vera_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nA moth hailing from the federal region of Lavido, emerged as a prominent figure during the Freedom Wars, a monumental insurrection against the reptilian invaders known as the Glaurungir Empire. Serving in the ranks of the Symbiotic Federation's army, Vera fought valiantly, only to witness the post-war disillusionment as the promised dissolution of the Federation did not materialize. Feeling disgruntled with the exploitation and broken promises, Vera sought a way to challenge the central government's control and restore autonomy to the regions, particularly the heavily exploited Vratenzk.\n\nRecognizing the growing discontent in Vratenzk, Vera dedicated herself to their cause. Despite not being a native of the region, she quickly earned the respect and admiration of the wasp-majority populace through her unwavering commitment. Vera selflessly provided guidance, training, and nurtured the rebel forces, instilling a sense of purpose and organization. Her acts of charity and generosity further endeared her to the people, earning her a loyal and semi-fanatical following.\n\nMonths of meticulous planning and preparation under Vera's guidance culminated in a well-coordinated uprising. Leveraging her exceptional expertise and strategic genius, the rebels swiftly overwhelmed the Federal forces, gaining control over significant portions of Vratenzk within a matter of days. Their momentum seemed unstoppable, with the capital on the horizon. However, the intervention of the Commonwealth of Fhireanta disrupted their progress. Seeking avian-majority lands, the Commonwealth joined forces with the Federation, pushing the rebels back and causing territorial losses.\n\nDespite setbacks, Vera's tactical prowess and the resilience of her forces strained the Federal economy, forcing them to the negotiation table. The coalition recognized Vratenzkian independence, but at a steep cost. The newly formed nation of Vratenzk had to relinquish the lost territories and bear exorbitant war debts from both nations. Understanding the necessity of compromise, Vera accepted the terms.\n\nAs a revered hero and liberator in the eyes of the local wasp population, the now 28-year-old Vera Triansbuer understands that her work is far from over. With Vratenzk's independence secured, she focuses on two crucial tasks. Firstly, she endeavors to shape a new ideology for the fledgling state, one that reflects the aspirations and values of its diverse inhabitants. Secondly, she tirelessly seeks ways to revitalize the devastated economy and deal with the war debts, ensuring a stable and prosperous future for the people of Vratenzk."
VRT_Vera2_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAs the newly independent nation of Vratenzk begins to forge its path, one name rises above the rest as a symbol of liberation and visionary leadership. Vera Triansbuer, the National Emancipator, stands as a formidable choice for those seeking a military commander with unparalleled expertise and an unwavering commitment to her people.\n\nHaving proven her mettle during the Freedom Wars against the Glaurungir Empire, Vera's tactical brilliance and indomitable spirit were instrumental in securing Vratenzk's independence. Her strategic genius allowed the rebel forces to swiftly overwhelm the occupying Federal troops, capturing significant territories in mere days. Despite facing setbacks when the Commonwealth of Fhireanta intervened, Vera's resilient command compelled the Federation to recognize Vratenzk's sovereignty.\n\nWith her reputation as a liberator and hero firmly established, Vera now offers her formidable leadership skills to the service of Vratenzk as a military commander. Her dedication to the cause is matched only by her deep understanding of the region's unique challenges and the pressing need for security and stability."
VRT_Makno_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 40\n\nMakno was born in Viasgorod, the capital of Vratenzk, he was very diconnected from his family and local community, instead he preferred to spend his times reading books and manuals in the local library, with military tactics being amongst his favorites, so much so that when the country got it's freedom he was given the position of commander, due to his advanced knowledge that few wasps could even rival."
VRT_Matthiv_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 53\n\nMatthiv isn't from the continent, he was born in far away lands, from what he says (which isn't much), he is from the western continent, from a small country that is barely mentioned anywhere else, he refuses to say the name, saying that he never really cared about his "homeland" and instead always cared about making a life for himself, and one of the ways he found success was to offer mercenary services to the locals, in a few years he would be seen as the most fierce fighter from his lands.\n\nAfter the collapse of the reptile empire Matthiv would make his way to the east, wanting to find personal glory for himself, to make his name more known for potential employers, he would participate in many fights and battles during the freedom wars, fighting for all sides that could hire him and doing anything he wanted, not caring about local laws, now he is being hired by the Vratenzkian state as a commander, a controversial choice that led to many nations denouncing the hiring."
VRT_Aletta_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 21\n\nWithin the newly independent nation of Vratenzk, one name resonates as a steadfast symbol of loyalty and devotion to the cause. Aletta Sybella, the Loyal Acolyte, stands as a formidable young general, epitomizing unwavering dedication and unwavering loyalty to the visionary leader, Vera Triansbuer.\n\nAletta, a native wasp of Vratenzk, has forged a profound connection with Vera that extends beyond admiration. She sees the moth leader not only as a liberator but as a living deity, a beacon of hope and guidance. Known as the Acolyte of Vera or simply the "Acolyte," Aletta's devotion borders on religious adoration.\n\nDriven by an unwavering desire to make Vera proud, Aletta has dedicated her life to serving the visionary leader. Her loyalty knows no bounds, and she would never waver or betray Vera, regardless of any offers or temptations. Aletta's commitment to her unofficial role as an acolyte is so profound that she even dons the exact same jacket as Vera, proudly wearing it as a symbol of her allegiance and devotion.\n\nJoining the military to align herself closely with Vera's ideals, Aletta chose to become a soldier in Vera's army to embody the teachings and principles espoused by her revered leader. As a young general, she commands her troops with unwavering loyalty and unwavering determination, ensuring they are trained to the highest standards and instilling in them the same reverence for Vera that she holds.\n\nAletta's unwavering dedication extends not only to Vera but also to the cause of Vratenzk. As a native of the region, she understands the struggles and aspirations of her fellow citizens, fighting tirelessly to safeguard their newfound independence and to create a society based on the teachings of Vera. Her strategic acumen, coupled with her indomitable loyalty, makes her a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield."
