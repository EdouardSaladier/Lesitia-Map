### LEADER DESC
TBZ_tiveask_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 37\n\nAndrei Rodion is a praying mantis, one who had always been a survivor. He grew up in the region of Tiveask, and had learned from an early age that life was tough and unforgiving there. But instead of working hard and trying to build a better life, Andrei had chose a different path.\n\nHe would form the Ephemeral Gang with like-minded individuals, a group of bandits who roamed the foggy region of Tiveask, preying on the weak and vulnerable. Andrei had no qualms about exploiting the civilians of Tiveask for his own gain. He and his gang would steal whatever they could get their claws on and sell it to foreign buyers for a tidy profit, one of their major investors being Akurii millionaires interested in "artifacts".\n\nA couple of years later new problems would arrive, the Tiveask Free Army had been a thorn in Andrei's side since its formation. Leonid Marat and his volunteers had been a constant obstacle to Andrei's schemes, and the two groups had clashed many times over the years. But despite the losses he had suffered at the hands of the Free Army, Andrei had remained resolute, building up his power and supporters on the west region of Tiveask.\n\nHe was and still is a ruthless and cold-blooded leader, feared by his own gang as much as he was by his enemies. He had no qualms about killing those who crossed him, and had built a reputation as one of the most dangerous figures in Tiveask.\n\nAndrei's past had left him with a deep-seated hatred for authority and those who would stand in his way. He saw the world as a harsh and unforgiving place, and believed that only the strong survived. To him, the civilians of Tiveask were nothing but pawns to be used and discarded, and he had no sympathy for their plight, believing they were at fault for their own situation, that they simply aren't trying hard enough.\n\nDespite his ruthless nature, there were some who admired Andrei for his strength and determination. His gang was fiercely loyal to him, and many saw him as a symbol of the freedom and independence that they so craved. But to those who knew the true cost of his actions, Andrei was nothing but a heartless villain, a monster who would stop at nothing to get what he wanted."

###EVENTS###

TBZ.1.t:0 "The Confrontation"
TBZ.1.d:0 "Soon after our conquest of the Federation we are starting to have issues with the imperial remnants, for a time we used to work together, specially when we were still a small warlord in the Tiveask fog, these imperial remains helping us run the more political and administrative side of things as we focused more on the pillaging and conquering, they being one of the very few groups willing to work with us, but now that we have unified the ex-federal lands it seems that the imperials want to break our informal agreement.\n\nTheir leader "Maul Incarnatto" claims that we don't have any true power in the nation, and, that without the help of the remnants we wouldn't have been able to expand further than Tiveask, therefore he has confronted us with a demand, that being that we hand power over to him, and allow him to govern the "nation" from now on, of course, this hasn't sat well with the Ephemeral Militias, who demand we ignore this demand and instead show Maul what he truly deserves."
TBZ.1.a:0 ""Relieve" Maul of His Duties"
TBZ.2.b:0 "We Can't Challenge the Remnants"
TBZ.2.t:0 "Allegiance Question"
TBZ.2.d:0 "After easily securing his rightful power Maul now questions which way to go forward, the fly was always a big loyalist towards the empire, having worked as a prison-warden for most of his life during the occupation and known to have no mercy towards his fellow insects, if anything he has nothing but contempt towards the insect race, executing many arthropods during his time as a warden, believing himself to be the only "good insect" that exists.\n\nEven if the choice seems obvious, that being that he should submit to Rheol's authority, Maul isn't quite so sure about it, he believing that the Tyrant is a bit too soft and that he doesn't have what it takes to bring the empire back, and that instead maybe Maul should be the one to set the example of what a new Glaurungir should look like."

TBZ.3.t:0 "Shadows of Loyalty"
TBZ.3.d:0 "With a brutal act of supremacy, Andrei solidifies his rule by eliminating a daring challenger, cementing his position as the unwavering leader of the new state, but Andrei now finds himself grappling with the complexities of governance, not knowing how to go about it\n\nSoon an unexpected offer materializes in the form of his close confidant, "Vermelio Truz." The ever-loyal Vermelio proposes to take on the role of internal manager, vowing to respect Andrei's leadership while diligently maintaining order across the newly acquired territories. Tempted by the prospect of a trusted ally handling internal matters, Andrei contemplates the offer. However, a subtle unease gnaws at him, as Vermelio's behavior begins to exhibit an unsettling and mysterious shift, prompting Andrei to tread cautiously in this delicate dance of power."
TBZ.5.a:0 ""I'm Not Interested""
TBZ.5.b:0 ""Seems Like A Good Deal to Me""
TBZ.4.t:0 "Betrayer's Embrace"
TBZ.4.d:0 "As a deceptive calm settled over the newly formed state, Andrei Rodion, swayed by the facade of loyalty, accepted Vermelio Truz's offer to take charge of internal affairs. For weeks, the country appeared to thrive under their dual leadership, flourishing like never before. However, lurking in the shadows, a treacherous plot took shape.\n\nWith venomous cunning, Vermelio, harboring a vengeful heart, orchestrates a sinister plan that shatters the very foundations of trust. In a swift, calculated strike, he ruthlessly assassinates Andrei, tearing away the veil of camaraderie to reveal the true depths of his malevolence. Unveiling a dark secret, Vermelio discloses his identity as a parent who endured the unbearable loss of his daughter at the hands of these very bandits. Fueled by an insatiable thirst for revenge, Vermelio cunningly infiltrated the Ephemeral Militias, ascending the ranks and gaining Andrei's trust to exact the ultimate retribution, and now he stands tall as the new leader of the nation, planning to enact his revenge against those that are guilty of banditry"
TBZ.6.a:0 "The End of Bandit Rule"
TBZ.5.t:0 "Reckoning's Descent"
TBZ.5.d:0 "As Vermelio Truz assumes his newfound authority, the fires of retribution blaze fiercely within him. In a chilling display of power, he orders the execution of several hundred high-ranking bandits, those whose guilt he can irrefutably prove. The swift retribution both satisfies a primal thirst for justice and sends a stark warning to all who once followed Andrei Rodion.\n\nYet, amidst the smoldering aftermath of his vengeance, a haunting realization takes root within Vermelio's consciousness. While a part of him relishes in the taste of triumph, a deeper, more sinister desire lurks just beneath the surface. Whispers of doubt and thoughts of going further begin to cloud his judgment, but for now, he suppresses them, allowing the malevolent musings to simmer in the depths of his mind.\n\nIn this tempest of conflicting emotions, Vermelio stands at the precipice of an uncharted path, torn between the pursuit of justice and the allure of more unforgiving measures. As his rule tightens its grip, the question remains - how far will Vermelio descend into the darkness that vengeance has unleashed? Only time will unveil the true extent of the avenger's resolve."
TBZ.7.a:0 ""Is This Enough?""
TBZ.6.t:0 "Descent into Darkness"
TBZ.6.d:0 "Haunted by a maddening thirst for unyielding justice, Vermelio Truz descends further into the abyss of his own making. Consumed by the paranoia that the bandits may escape his grasp, he orders the nation's borders to be sealed, a grim proclamation heralding the dawn of a ruthless new policy. No longer content with irrefutable evidence, Vermelio now brandishes shaky justifications, utilizing any means necessary to deliver his brand of retribution.\n\nIn an unforgiving show of force, the people bear witness to Vermelio's wrath. A merciless army descends upon the lands, leaving in their wake a trail of devastation and unimaginable carnage. Hundreds of thousands are felled. The ruthless policy, extending even to the families of the accused and petty criminals, like shoplifters, paints a portrait of unbridled tyranny.\n\nFar from remorseful, Vermelio relishes in the macabre symphony of vengeance. Each drop of blood spilled becomes a perverse testament to the bandits' sins, and the crimson tide washes away any lingering doubts in his heart. A dark exhilaration courses through his veins as he witnesses the malefactors paying with their lives for the horrors they once wrought.\n\nAs Vermelio revels in the aftermath, a chilling transformation unfolds before him. The avenger's soul plunges deeper into the abyss, embracing the monstrous aspects of his once-honorable cause. He has become the very darkness he sought to vanquish, forever bound to the consequences of his merciless pursuit of justice."
TBZ.8.a:0 "They Shall Pay With Their Blood"
TBZ.71.t:0 "Devastation of the North"
TBZ.71.d:0 "In a descent into madness, Vermelio Truz unleashes an unbridled crimson storm upon the northern states of the country. Fueled by an insatiable thirst for retribution, he forges ahead with increasingly looser justifications, ordering his men to strike down anyone they even remotely suspect of having ties to the bandits.\n\nUnder this merciless decree, the once-prosperous northern cities fall prey to devastation on an unimaginable scale. Streets once teeming with life are reduced to haunting echoes, and entire sections crumble under the weight of ruthless onslaughts. Homes turn to ash, and lives are lost in the relentless pursuit of perceived justice.\n\nAs Vermelio's rampage reaches its zenith, the very fabric of the nation shatters beneath the weight of his wrath. The northern states lie in ruins, bearing scars that may never heal. In his wake, countless innocent lives lie lost, victims of a merciless frenzy that shows no signs of abating.\n\nYet, within the haze of destruction, a haunting question lingers; Can there truly be justice in such unforgiving vengeance, or has Vermelio become a monstrous echo of the very bandits he once sought to vanquish? The nation trembles, trapped in the clutches of a ruthless avenger, and the future hangs in a delicate balance between the darkness he perpetuates and the faint glimmer of hope for redemption."
TBZ.9.a:0 "None Will be Spared"
TBZ.8.t:0 "Devastation of the South"`ce knows no bounds as he turns his sights toward the south, leading the country into a sanguine cataclysm. The major southern cities, teeming with life and urban splendor, now face a fate akin to their northern counterparts – devastation and ruin.\n\nEntire urban landscapes crumble, as once-thriving metropolises are reduced to haunting echoes of their former glory. The once-flourishing southern states now writhe in the grip of despair, their dreams and hopes crushed under the weight of Vermelio's malevolent reign.\n\nAs the death toll soars and the nation drowns in the sea of its own blood, a chilling revelation takes hold; Vermelio's pursuit of justice has morphed into a depraved thirst for destruction. In his relentless quest for revenge, he has forsaken the very ideals that drove him, and his actions now echo those of the very bandits he vowed to punish.\n\nThe land stands scarred and tainted, its people trembling beneath the shadows of a tyrant they once hailed as a savior. In the throes of this sanguine cataclysm, the nation stands on the precipice of irreparable darkness, and the echoes of its once-glorious past are silenced by the unending symphony of devastation."
TBZ.10.a:0 "This Is What They Deserve"
TBZ.9.t:0 "The City of Ashes"
TBZ.9.d:0 "In a chilling crescendo of vengeful fury, Vermelio Truz's sights now lock onto the heart of the nation, the central region. Consumed by an unrelenting hatred, this is where the bandits first planted their roots, and it is here that Vermelio seeks to exact the ultimate retribution. No longer burdened by even the pretense of justification, he embraces a dark resolve to raze the land to the ground, with the city of Falyuka, the very "capital" of the bandits, bearing the full weight of his wrath.\n\nWith a malevolence unparalleled, Vermelio sets his sights on obliterating Falyuka from the map. This once-proud city, steeped in history and culture, now stands marked for annihilation, a symbolic sacrifice to his insatiable thirst for revenge. Driven by the memory of the bandits' wicked machinations and the agony they wrought, he disregards any remnants of his buganity, allowing the darkness within to reign supreme.\n\nIn the looming shadows of devastation, the final region trembles, its fate entwined with the vengeance of a soul lost to hatred. The very essence of the nation stands at stake, for with the eradication of Falyuka comes the erasure of an integral part of its identity. The cries of the innocent rise like desperate whispers, but Vermelio remains deaf to their plea, possessed by the demons of his own making."
TBZ.11.a:0 "Rightful Vengeance"
TBZ.10.t:0 "A Moment of Reckoning"
TBZ.10.d:0 "In the midst of chaos and destruction, a flicker of resistance emerges in the form of Marco Russo, a figure from Vermelio's past who dared to challenge the avenger's descent into darkness. As a former military personnel, Marco had once believed in Vermelio's sanity and modesty, but now he stands disillusioned, witnessing the monstrous transformation his friend has undergone.\n\nSummoning courage, Marco confronts Vermelio, casting a mirror upon the depths of his soul. With unwavering conviction, he accuses Vermelio of becoming no better than the bandits he sought to punish, betraying the very ideals he once held dear. The words strike deep into Vermelio's conscience, stirring a whirlwind of guilt and confusion within him.\n\nAs emotions whirl, Vermelio's hand instinctively reaches for his pocket pistol, pointing it at Marco, teetering on the precipice of a fateful choice. In this tense moment, he faces an unimaginable decision - to continue down the path of relentless destruction or to confront the stark reality of his sins.\n\nCaught between the lingering remnants of his past self and the merciless monster he has become, Vermelio stands at a crossroads of destiny. In a desperate bid for redemption, he must choose between silencing Marco's words with a pull of the trigger or turning the barrel upon himself, ending the malevolent reign before it can claim yet another innocent soul."

TBZ.11.d:0 "In the aftermath of Vermelio's demise, a somber and conflicted Marco Russo now finds himself at the helm of a ravaged nation, the once-glorious land reduced to ruins. Anger and pity intertwine within him as he reflects upon the life and death of his fallen friend. Marco understands the unimaginable pain that haunted Vermelio, the haunting shadow of a lost daughter that drove him down the path of darkness. But he also acknowledges that nothing could justify the merciless rampage that had engulfed the nation.\n\nAmidst the haze of confusion and guilt, Marco knows that the time for introspection will come, but for now, the shattered country needs hope, direction, and a chance at redemption. With a heavy heart, he accepts the responsibility thrust upon him and realizes that he must become a beacon of light for a land lost in the abyss.\n\nAs the new leader, Marco sets his sights on the arduous task ahead; the reconstruction effort that will mend not only the physical scars but also the fractured souls of its people. With determination and resilience, he vows to steer the nation away from the shadows it was plunged into.\n\nUnited in the vision of a brighter future, the people find solace in Marco's leadership, and the seeds of hope begin to take root. A new era dawns, one marked by reconciliation, forgiveness, and an unyielding commitment to rebuilding from the ashes."

Their leader, Maul Incarnatto, had a repuation as a merciless enforcer when he worked for Glaurungir. Someone of his expertise could help us silence those who would get in the way of our power."
