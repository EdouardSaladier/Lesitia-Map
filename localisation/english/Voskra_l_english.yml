VOS_kallista_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 29\n\nKallista Sokolova is a military officer of the Symbiotic Federation currently serving as the governor and self proclaimed regent of the Voskra Provinces, having obtained her current status as a result of regicide. While a ruthless and ambitious individual, Kallista professes to act in the interest of all Voskran citizens, justifying her actions as necessary to unlock the true potential of antkind.\n\nBorn into the highly rigid and stratified society of the ants, as a child of the Queen Kallista should have been another faceless drone in the teeming sea of the great ant masses. However, the onset of global nuclear war and the collapse of the old Empires created a uniquely chaotic situation, one that thrust Kallista into the spotlight. As the world crumbled around them, Kallista rose to a position of leadership, commanding an small militia. With the eventual return of stability, Kallista was rewarded by promotion to a full general and integration into the professionalized military of the Voskran state. Her services during the immediate aftermath of the Nuclear exchange had made her into a paragon among both her people and the other insectoid species, creating the unique situation of an individual ant rising to something of a celebrity status.\n\nKallista saw the incorporation of the Voskran states into the greater Symbiotic Federation as a betrayal of her people. Through her military service she had been forged into a proud patriot, ever aware of the long past glories of the Voskran Empire, and a proud supporter of the colony system of life. With the ants now taking a subordinate role within a federation that proclaimed all it's members as equals, Kallista was determined to protect her peoples future, and took the drastic step of organizing a coup against the Queen; installing herself as regent.\n\nVoskra now stands independent and free as the Federation crumbles around them, but this newfound freedom has come with a price. Kallista now has to navigate the treacherous maze of collapsing powers, new rivals, and old enemies. Voskra was always a strong regional power and now it finds itself surrounded by weaker states. If it can strike hard and fast, it stands a good chance of gaining valuable territory and bulwarking itself against any outside threat."
