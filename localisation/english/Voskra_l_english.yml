VOS_kallista_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 29\n\nKallista Sokolova is a military officer of the Symbiotic Federation currently serving as the governor and self proclaimed regent of the Voskra Provinces, having obtained her current status as a result of regicide. While a ruthless and ambitious individual, Kallista professes to act in the interest of all Voskran citizens, justifying her actions as necessary to unlock the true potential of antkind.\n\nBorn into the highly rigid and stratified society of the ants, as a child of the Queen Kallista should have been another faceless drone in the teeming sea of the great ant masses. However, the onset of global nuclear war and the collapse of the old Empires created a uniquely chaotic situation, one that thrust Kallista into the spotlight. In the mad scramble to secure independence from the now devastated Empire, she found herself on the front lines, operating in defense of the fledgling ant nation state. As the world crumbled around them, Kallista rose to a position of leadership, commanding an armed band composed mostly of her fellow Voskran ants. While they operated primarily in defense of Voskran citizens, Kallista and her brigade did participate in some of the more infamous massacres of the lizard occupiers, earning her an infamous reputation among their former occupiers while making her a folk hero among the oppressed bug species of the empire. With the eventual return of stability, Kallista was rewarded by promotion to a full general and integration into the professionalized military of the Voskran state. Her services during the immediate aftermath of the Nuclear exchange had made her into a paragon among both her people and the other insectoid species, creating the unique situation of an individual ant rising to something of a celebrity status. Many of her formicid critics later attributed such unforeseen individuality as the cause of the political complications that arose later in her career.\n\nKallista saw the incorporation of the Voskran states into the greater Symbiotic Federation as a betrayal of her people. Through her military service she had been forged into a proud patriot, ever aware of the long past glories of the Voskran Empire, and a proud supporter of the colony system of life. With the ants now taking a subordinate role within a federation that proclaimed all it's members as equals, Kallista was determined to protect her peoples future, and took the drastic step of organizing a coup against the Queen. In a now infamous scene, Kallista led a division of loyal troops into the capital, securing key positions and placing both the queen and key figures under guard. In a dramatic show trial, Kallista accused the Queen of both incompetence and treason, decrying a continuation of her rule to be a betrayal of the greater Voskran nation. The sentence was a foregone conclusion, and by the end of the trial Kallista had personally severed the head of the former Queen with her mandibles. Before the headless corpse even hit the floor, she declared the formation of a regency with herself as absolute ruler of the Voskran state.\n\nVoskra now exists in an uneasy state. Kallista has promised a return to greatness, but finds herself beset with the need to firmly cement her own power and improve the poor state of the Voskran nation at large. As such, she has been unable to enact any meaningful plan to deal with the obstacle that is the Symbiotic Federation and recreate the Voskran Imperium of old, being forced to instead stay within the relative safety and stability present within the large federation. But in Kallista’s mind these are temporary problems, and she remains confident of a future defined by the ever expanding colony of the Formicid peoples."
