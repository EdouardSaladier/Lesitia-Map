### LEADER DESC
AVN_pyotr_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 29\n\nPyotr Kavinse might be considered young compared to other leaders, but his determination and fierceness towards Avenska's better future and preservation make it so he is trusted by the population, so far, there hasn't been any meaningful political movement aiming to remove him, he is sometimes jokingly called the "Tyrant with a Feather Fist" due to his moderation and level-headedness when it comes to his rulership, not ordering any large or small-scale persecution of his adversaries or shutting down public discourse for example, some even say he might be opening the country up for a possible democratization.\n\nPyotr was born in a small religious commune on a very remote area of what would be the country today, during his childhood he had very limited interactions with reptiles, making so his opinion of them wasn't that negative when comparing to other insects; during his time in the community he would get very interested in old literary works of Avenska, together with old philosophers and great thinkers, after all, Avenska's history was over a millenia old, there was a lot to get interested by, this interest would cause him to form a cultural preservation society and get quite a bit of attention from other mantises, which would ultimately culminate with him being appointed as the provisional leader of the country after the revolt, where the country was finally free from the Empire."
AVN_Peter_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 29\n\nPyotr is considered by many to be a very gentle commander, he rarely blows up on someone and is pretty calm in many situations, leading him to be the favorite of the soldiers, even if due to his niceness sometimes he doesn't correct incorrect behaviours the way he should."
AVN_Albert_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 44\n\nAlbert was never a military leader of any kind, instead he was just a popular witchdoctor living in the woods of Avenska, later he would be approached by Pyotr to help him form the new state because of his popularity, Albert agreed and soon enough the leader appointed him to be a commander in his newly formed army, it took some time to train the brown mantis into being a good commander but in the end it seemed to have worked out quite well."
AVN_Borys_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 52\n\nBorys has some experience leading groups, being the founder and priest of his own ecological cult, telling people they need less to live and should free themselves from their earthly belongings, it was a bit of a controversial decision to give him power in the army due to his cultist ways, but in the end Pyotr thought by giving Borys power he would be able to control the growing Dead Leaf Cult, giving him a boost of popularity."
