SED_Railanderson_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 51\n\nRailanderson Olivensa is a proud dragonfly from the region of Seda, a land known for its rich history and traditions. Raised in a family that placed great value on preserving Sedanase culture, Railanderson grew up steeped in the stories and customs of his people.\n\nAs he came of age, Railanderson became increasingly involved in the political affairs of Seda, using his knowledge of Sedanase history and tradition to advocate for policies that would protect and preserve their way of life. He became a vocal opponent of the collectivist movement, which sought to abolish traditional Sedanase customs in favor of a more unified and homogenized society.\n\nRailanderson saw the collectivists as a threat to everything he held dear. He believed that their push for uniformity would destroy the unique cultural identity of Seda, erasing centuries of history and tradition in the process. Fueled by his passion for his homeland, he became a fierce opponent of the collectivists, working tirelessly to prevent their influence from spreading any further.\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse of the Symbiotic Federation, Railanderson's worst fears were realized. The collectivists, emboldened by the chaos and uncertainty of the times, began to make inroads into Seda, threatening to upend the traditions and way of life that Railanderson and his ancestors had worked so hard to preserve.\n\nDetermined to protect his people, Railanderson took matters into his own hands. He rallied the Sedanase people behind him, leading a movement to drive the collectivists out of the region once and for all. His efforts were successful, and the collectivists were forced to flee south, where they established their own community in the newly-formed Seda Commune.\n\nWhile Railanderson was hailed as a hero by his fellow Sedanase, he was left with a bitter taste in his mouth. The fact that the collectivists had been allowed to gain a foothold in Seda at all was a source of great frustration and anger for him. He felt that the collapse of the Symbiotic Federation had opened the door to all manner of outsiders, many of whom had little respect for the traditions and customs of his people.\n\nRailanderson dedicates himself to maintaining the Sedanase way of life, working tirelessly to preserve their customs and traditions for future generations. Though he remained wary of outsiders, he never lost sight of the fact that unity and cooperation would be essential to the continued success of the new confederation."
