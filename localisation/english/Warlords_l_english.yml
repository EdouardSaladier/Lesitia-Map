RFT.2.t:0 "Leader Question"
RFT.2.d:0 "The Republican Front was held together by the combined effort of the old social democratic, conservative and centrist parties of the Federation, with them setting aside their differences temporarily to focus on stabilizing the realm, but now that the wars of unification are finally over the differences between the parties begin to appear again, with the main point of contention being that of who will be the president of this reborn Federation.\n\nThere are currently three choices of who that would be, with the parties sending forward their best representatives, the first one is the current leader of the front Léo Laze, a lifelong centrist who always tries to find a good compromise for all parties involved; The second option is Alexandre Renaud, leader of the conservative party, someone who is not very keen of socialists and liberals and that defends the so-called "Insect Traditions" and by last there is the leader of the social democratic party Mathieu Dufresne, someone who always prided himself of helping to start multiple social programs in the old Federation."
RFT.2.a:0 "Léo Led Us to Victory"
RFT.2.b:0 "Alexandre Will Bring us Strenght"
RFT.3.c:0 "Mathieu Will Make Our Lifes Better"
KAK.1.t:0 "The Issue of Democracy"
KAK.1.d:0 "One of Luã Vescitu's main promises as soon as the collapse of the Federation happened was that he would bring it back and that he would restablish democracy, promising freedom for all of those that sided with him, now that time has come, the Federation is back and the question of what happens next is in everyone's minds\n\nThe obvious thing would be to do as he promised, and restore federal democracy back to what it originally was, making so the first president of the Federation "Equis Tritio" assumes leadership of the nation, some who had to step them a few days into office due to unexpected health problems, thankfully seems like he has made a full recovery and is apt to rule again; In the other hand Luã could decide to stick around for longer if he feels like that the nation isn't ready for democracy yet, after all some reforms are necessary to prevent another collapse, the choice however is ultimately up to him."
KAK.1.a:0 "We Shouldn't Rush Democracy"
KAK.1.b:0 "We Won't Betray our Promises"
faction_VRT:0 "Invite Vratenzk to the Archean Union"
faction_VRT_desc:0 "The Federation's past with Vratenzk isn't a pretty one, but maybe due to the fact we aren't the same as we once were, the government of Vratenzk might be more friendly towards us and the idea of joining the Union."
faction_BOR:0 "Invite Borca to the Archean Union"
faction_AVN:0 "Invite Avenska to the Archean Union"
faction_AVN_desc:0 "Avenskan-Federal relations were always pretty cold, with the two nations rarely going along with each other on anything, but, in modern times it seems Avenska has toned down their tone and general hostility, therefore they might not oppose the idea of joining the Union."
faction_BOR_desc:0 "Besides the Federation, Borca is one of the few countries in the continent that believes in democracy, it's very likely they would accept to ally with us."
BOR.1.t:0 "Faction Invite from the Federation"
BOR.1.d:0 "The newly re-formed Federation has invited us to their faction, called "Archean Union", they claim to want to form a anti-rheol and anti-reactionary bloc with our help, and that this has nothing to do with expanding their own influence, but, at the same time, it seems like they might react poorly if we refuse the invitation."
BOR.1.a:0 "We're Stronger Together"
BOR.2.b:0 "We Won't be Intimitated"
demand_RFT_desc:0 "The Republican Front is what's left of the political system of the Federation, it's very likely they will take the opportunity to join us."
demand_LAV_desc:0 "Lavido was one of the most loyal regions of the Federation, there is a chance, even if slim, that they might accept to join us due to this."
demand_ACS_desc:0 "The Southern Army of the Federation was one of the most loyal and elite troops that the Federation had to offer, they are bound to accept to come back to us, or at the very least we have better odds of them accepting than anyone else."
WRL_unification_desc:0 "The Federation was once the biggest and most powerful Insect state, even with it's flaws it was still seen as the representative of the arthropod races and to bring it back would bring us much needed stability and unity, together with giving us a favorable position in the diplomatic world."

ACS.1.t:0 "Symbiotica Demands our Annexation"
ACS.1.d:0 "The Federal Exiles that have taken power in the Rescanie islands, now known as "the Republic of Symbiotica", have sent forward a ultimatum demanding our annexation, claiming that due to the fact they claim to be the old government we are obligated by law to serve them, and by refusing to do so would be an act of betrayal to the Federation and her institutions."
