TBZ.1.t:0 "The Confrontation"
TBZ.1.d:0 "Soon after our conquest of the Federation we are starting to have issues with the imperial remnants, for a time we used to work together, specially when we were still a small warlord in the Tiveask fog, these imperial remains helping us run the more political and administrative side of things as we focused more on the pillaging and conquering, they being one of the very few groups willing to work with us, but now that we have unified the ex-federal lands it seems that the imperials want to break our informal agreement.\n\nTheir leader "Maul Incarnatto" claims that we don't have any true power in the nation, and, that without the help of the remnants we wouldn't have been able to expand further than Tiveask, therefore he has confronted us with a demand, that being that we hand power over to him, and allow him to govern the "nation" from now on, of course, this hasn't sat well with the Ephemeral Militias, who demand we ignore this demand and instead show Maul what he truly deserves."
TBZ.1.a:0 ""Relieve" Maul of His Duties"
TBZ.2.b:0 "We Can't Challenge the Remnants"
TBZ.2.t:0 "Allegiance Question"
TBZ.2.d:0 "After easily securing his rightful power Maul now questions which way to go forward, the fly was always a big loyalist towards the empire, having worked as a prison-warden for most of his life during the occupation and known to have no mercy towards his fellow insects, if anything he has nothing but contempt towards the insect race, executing many arthropods during his time as a warden, believing himself to be the only "good insect" that exists.\n\nEven if the choice seems obvious, that being that he should submit to Rheol's authority, Maul isn't quite so sure about it, he believing that the Tyrant is a bit too soft and that he doesn't have what it takes to bring the empire back, and that instead maybe Maul should be the one to set the example of what a new Glaurungir should look like."

RFT.2.t:0 "Leader Question"
RFT.2.d:0 "The Republican Front was held together by the combined effort of the old social democratic, conservative and centrist parties of the Federation, with them setting aside their differences temporarily to focus on stabilizing the realm, but now that the wars of unification are finally over the differences between the parties begin to appear again, with the main point of contention being that of who will be the president of this reborn Federation.\n\nThere are currently three choices of who that would be, with the parties sending forward their best representatives, the first one is the current leader of the front Léo Laze, a lifelong centrist who always tries to find a good compromise for all parties involved; The second option is Alexandre Renaud, leader of the conservative party, someone who is not very keen of socialists and liberals and that defends the so-called "Insect Traditions" and by last there is the leader of the social democratic party Mathieu Dufresne, someone who always prided himself of helping to start multiple social programs in the old Federation."

KAK.1.t:0 "The Issue of Democracy"
KAK.1.d:0 "One of Luã Vescitu's main promises as soon as the collapse of the Federation happened was that he would bring it back and that he would restablish democracy, promising freedom for all of those that sided with him, now that time has come, the Federation is back and the question of what happens next is in everyone's minds\n\nThe obvious thing would be to do as he promised, and restore federal democracy back to what it originally was, making so the first president of the Federation "Equis Tritio" assumes leadership of the nation, some who had to step them a few days into office due to unexpected health problems, thankfully seems like he has made a full recovery and is apt to rule again; In the other hand Luã could decide to stick around for longer if he feels like that the nation isn't ready for democracy yet, after all some reforms are necessary to prevent another collapse, the choice however is ultimately up to him."

faction_AVN:0 "Invite Avenska to the Archean Union"
faction_AVN_desc:0 "Avenskan-Federal relations were always pretty cold, with the two nations rarely going along with each other on anything, but, in modern times it seems Avenska has toned down their tone and general hostility, therefore they might not oppose the idea of joining the Union."
faction_BOR_desc:0 "Besides the Federation, Borca is one of the few countries in the continent that believes in democracy, it's very likely they would accept to ally with us."
BOR.1.t:0 "Faction Invite from the Federation"
BOR.1.d:0 "The newly re-formed Federation has invited us to their faction, called "Archean Union", they claim to want to form a anti-rheol and anti-reactionary bloc with our help, and that this has nothing to do with expanding their own influence, but, at the same time, it seems like they might react poorly if we refuse the invitation."
