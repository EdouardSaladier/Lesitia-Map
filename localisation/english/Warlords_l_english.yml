RFT.2.t:0 "Leader Question"
RFT.2.d:0 "The Republican Front was held together by the combined effort of the old social democratic, conservative and centrist parties of the Federation, with them setting aside their differences temporarily to focus on stabilizing the realm, but now that the wars of unification are finally over the differences between the parties begin to appear again, with the main point of contention being that of who will be the president of this reborn Federation.\n\nThere are currently three choices of who that would be, with the parties sending forward their best representatives, the first one is the current leader of the front Léo Laze, a lifelong centrist who always tries to find a good compromise for all parties involved; The second option is Alexandre Renaud, leader of the conservative party, someone who is not very keen of socialists and liberals and that defends the so-called "Insect Traditions" and by last there is the leader of the social democratic party Mathieu Dufresne, someone who always prided himself of helping to start multiple social programs in the old Federation."

KAK.1.t:0 "The Issue of Democracy"
KAK.1.d:0 "One of Luã Vescitu's main promises as soon as the collapse of the Federation happened was that he would bring it back and that he would restablish democracy, promising freedom for all of those that sided with him, now that time has come, the Federation is back and the question of what happens next is in everyone's minds\n\nThe obvious thing would be to do as he promised, and restore federal democracy back to what it originally was, making so the first president of the Federation "Equis Tritio" assumes leadership of the nation, some who had to step them a few days into office due to unexpected health problems, thankfully seems like he has made a full recovery and is apt to rule again; In the other hand Luã could decide to stick around for longer if he feels like that the nation isn't ready for democracy yet, after all some reforms are necessary to prevent another collapse, the choice however is ultimately up to him."

BOR.1.d:0 "The newly re-formed Federation has invited us to their faction, called "Archean Union", they claim to want to form a anti-rheol and anti-reactionary bloc with our help, and that this has nothing to do with expanding their own influence, but, at the same time, it seems like they might react poorly if we refuse the invitation."
