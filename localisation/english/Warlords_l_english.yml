RFT.2.d:0 "The Republican Front was held together by the combined effort of the old social democratic, conservative and centrist parties of the Federation, with them setting aside their differences temporarily to focus on stabilizing the realm, but now that the wars of unification are finally over the differences between the parties begin to appear again, with the main point of contention being that of who will be the president of this reborn Federation\n\nThere are currently three choices of who that would be, with the parties sending forward their best representatives, the first one is the current leader of the front Léo Laze, a lifelong centrist who always tries to find a good compromise for all parties involved; The second option is Alexandre Renaud, leader of the conservative party, someone who is not very keen of socialists and liberals and that defends the so-called "Insect Traditions" and by last there is the leader of the social democratic party Mathieu Dufresne, someone who always prided himself of helping to start multiple social programs in the old Federation."
