 arc_laser_desc:0 "By replacing the old laser mediums, such as gas or crystal, with plasma, arc lasers can generate more intense beams, with greatly-improved efficiency. The plasma is contained using magnetic fields, and once the weapon has accumulated enough charge, a lightning arc surges through the plasma, releasing an intense burst of energy in the form of light - which the Arc Laser then weaponizes into a deadly pulse. The true beauty of this technology is the rapid recharge rate of the plasma, creating a combat laser with greater efficiency and range than any previous generation."

While infantrymens cannot reach this weakness using direct fire, plunging fire attack weapons will allow us to do this.

However, this has now been over come with the development of man-portable recoilless rifles. By ejecting propellant gas out of the back of the weapon, thus creating a forward thrust, we can effectively counteract the recoil and completely remove it, making many of the other far more bulky anti-recoil additions uncesseray and reduce the overall weight of the weapon, meaning that anti-armour weapons can be deployed with our special forces as well as conventional ground troops."

 total_vacuum_bore:0 "Total Vacuum Bore"
 total_vacuum_bore_desc:0 "Even though we have improved the guns themselves, no amount of firepower can overcome the friction caused by the round being fired at hypersonic speed. To circumvent this, we will remove all the air from the bore of the gun. Once in a vaccum, there will be no friction when fired, reducing overheating and increasing the projectile's speed."

 retroflector_active_camouflage_desc:0 "Uniforms can only go so far with colors and patterns, heat-absorbent material and specialized material before they just can no longer keep up with the enemy detection capacities. The retroflector active camouflage is the answer to this problem: complex mechanical uniforms will reflect the light around the infiltrator, greatly reducing its visibility. Additional electronic warfare capabilities and multi-terrain features been added into the design, with functions as a stealth suit, an armor and a environmental-protection-kit at once."

 underwater_breathing_system:0 "Underwater Breathing System"
 underwater_breathing_system_desc:0 "Warding rivers require boats of diving suits, modern infiltrators require neither. Slightly retrofitting the infiltration suit to be water-proof and adding a breathing system makes this upgrade every infiltrators into a combat diver. This way they can hide away deep in water and move through without the need to reach the surface anymore. Rivers, as the jungle-fighter would say, become our highways."
 
 thermal_emission_inhibitor:0 "Thermal Emission Inhibitor"
 thermal_emission_inhibitor_desc:0 "Body, weapons and equipment emits a lot of heat, making them extremely easy to detect with thermal cameras. An all-around system of thermal absorption will make sure to conceal our troop's thermal signature and prevent the enemy from finding our infiltrators in enemy territory. "
 
 phased_array_optical_holographs:0 "Phased Array Optical Holograph"
 phased_array_optical_holographs_desc:0 "By making use of complex modern holographic systems, our infiltrators are not only able to completely conceal their presence but also to create entire complex system of deception and illusion to bring our enemies into unfavorable positions where they can easily be ambushed, separated and destroyed. By being able to attack at any time at any place, our infiltrators can now put the enemy in a constant state of panic, reducing their unit's cohesion and morale."

 foliage_penetrating_vision:0 "Foliage Penetrating Vision"
 foliage_penetrating_vision_desc:0 "Leaves are a hindrance to both detection of enemy troops and targeting. A new AI-algorithm build within the visors of our infiltrators will remove this visual hindrance, so that our hunters will be one step ahead of the enemy even within the deepest jungles, the thickest forests and the widest swamps."
 
 open_terrain_stealth_adaptation:0 "Open Terrain Stealth Adaptation"
 open_terrain_stealth_adaptation_desc:0 "Infiltrators are excellent when protected by the terrain's natural cover. Open ground however has proven more difficult to master for our hidden combat forces and are still a hindrance to their operations. With a better adaptation both to tactics, doctrine and overall mission objectives we will be able to overcome this challenge and allow for even deeper strikes of enemy positions on open ground."

Our new air troopers will so make do without them, as the modern weapon for their task is the jet pack. It may be both loud and heavy, but it allow allows the trooper to have a much superior mobility and speed, both on the ground and in the air."

 gyroscopic_aiming_assistance_desc:0 "Sudden movements while in the air cannot be overcome with training alone, preventing accurate aiming during flight. To solve this problem, we will equip our aerial troopers with a gyroscopic aiming assistance which will allow them to hit their target during flight, as long as it is integrated well into the existing equipment and the our forces are trained to use them accordingly."
 
 auditory_dampener:0 "Auditory Dampener"
 auditory_dampener_desc:0 "Jet Packs are loud, and their noise often warn the enemy troops of our advance, allowing them to prepare. Making a jet pack quieter is a hard task, but one that can be solved which will make our air-borne forces much more lethal and combat-ready in a real fight."
 
 fast_target_acquisition:0 "Fast Target Acquisition"
 fast_target_acquisition_desc:0 "The new high flight mobility our paratroopers are developing requires both a doctrinal and material change to our gear. Most importantly, a new AI system that allows our troopers to pre-mark targets and rapidly attack them during short air sorties. This way both action and reaction of our aerial troopers will be much higher and effective."
 
 personal_hoverlift_packs:0 "Aerial Assault Hoverlift Packs"
 personal_hoverlift_packs_desc:0 "Hoverlifts can carry more gear with a lighter power-pack without making as much noise as the jet packs, and most importantly they do offer an even greater mobility and flight-control.

 light_weight_rocket_launcher:0 "Light Weight Rocket Launcher"
 light_weight_rocket_launcher_desc:0 "This very light version of the classical rocket launcher gives our aerial troopers a much needed bost to their offensive abilities, both against enemy personnel and lightly armored vehicles. Rather than being a separate weapon worn by the soldier, it is directly integrated within the fligt suit, and is easily accessible whenever it is needed."
 
 kinetic_reduction_braces:0 "Kinetic Reduction Braces"
 kinetic_reduction_braces_desc:0 "While soaring in the air is now easy, landing safely without breaking legs or equipment is the hard part, especially under enemy fire. By integrating highly advanced kinetic reduction braces within the boot of our soldiers, they are able to land safely even from the height of a 8-story building, making landing a trivial affair as long as it is done in the right position."
