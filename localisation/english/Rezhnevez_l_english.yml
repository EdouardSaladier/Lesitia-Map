### LEADER DESC
REZ_Alban_desc:0 "Artist: ErinArtista826\n\nAge: 24\n\nAlban Briz isn't a native to the region, his ancestors were, before the forced relocation, being brought over to the west to work as forced labor for a whole century in the roach region of Resse by the Empire of Glaurungir, meaning that Alban is actually native to Resse, as he was born and raised there, due to this he started cultivating quite the respect for the local culture and people, specially by the way they protect, fed and housed the enslaved rabbits, helping many of them escape the horrible situation they found themselves in.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Empire the enslaved rabbits were finally free, and that meant they were also free to return to their old lands, but there was a problem, due to the century of separation the two cultures had drifted apart, to the point they were alien to each other, meaning natives to the region didn't get along with the returning rabbits, that sentiment by the rabbits who didn't like the natives either, that sentiment being shared by Alban, who thinks the region is "outdated" and also believes the local culture is "insufficient" and "weak", instead he wishes to transform the local culture into what he saw in Resse, wanting to build a strong national indentity by appropriating and copying the culture he was raised on."
REZ_Canncine_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 32\n\nCanncine is much different from many other rabbits, both because of her appearence and because of her personality, she is known for being very emotional and angry at times but at others she is very calm and nice, nobody is sure of what the reason for this wildly different personalities may be, but they do know she is quite the good commander no matter what mood she might be in."
REZ_Imenund_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 44\n\nImenund was a naval commander in the old reptilian puppet state that used to occupy the region of Resse to the west, after the collapse of the empire she would end up going east like many other rabbits, here she didn't find any work as a naval leader, so she ended up being forced to join the army instead, but due to her leadership skills she would later get a higher patent and eventually become a general in her own right."
