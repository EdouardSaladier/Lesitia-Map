REO_Lars_desc:0 "Age: 54\n\nLars Glaidir is a anomaly in Glaurungirs high command, as in that he still lives. As the nukes set Glaurungir ablaze was most of Glaurungirs upper command structure simply atomized, the few that survived scattered across a vast and burning empire that hat little use for the politicians, aristocrats and generals that led the nation to feel the power of the sun upon its own scales. Glaurungir fell silent after that, yet the man that would become the Tyrant of Rheol remained.\n\nGlaidir was once the High Prefect of Glaurungirs Finances, Lord of its mighty ministry of taxation, that combines the colonial affairs of Glaurungir, its war-time production and the finance ministry into one. And Glaidir was maybe the best person ever to fit that job, the war-economy he build never broke down as it was task to support Glaurungirs many, many fronts in its western campaign. Even as Nuklear Warheads rained down upon the Empire was his war-industry only disrupted, but not destroyed. A fact, that made Glaidir one of the most powerful leaders of the post-apocalyptic Glaurungir and one of the first members of the Government of Imperial Strength, that took rulership over the empire shortly after the war. This council however was unstable and Glaurungirs politics had lost nothing from its murderous nature as the internal feuds between different faction escalated into a hidden civil war between the remaining high-leaders of the empire, each trying to keep their region of control as the empire threatens to finely splinter and break apart. Only the few remaining centers of strength kept the Empire together.\n\nIt was in this chaos, that Glaidir made his move and set his eyes on Rheol. Glaurungir could not be saved from the inside, so he would have to rebuild it from its edges. And Rheol had already been the center of his personal realm of influence for many years now. So he was the first to openly defy the Government of Imperial Strength by declaiming himself Tyrant of Rheol.\n\nTyrant, in Glaurungian terms is that a holy word and a holy position. Claiming this title is only a step below declaring oneself Emperor. A position that Glaidir has now set his eyes upon. Glaurungir is his Mission. And if he needs to bleed to world white to rebuild the Empire, he will do so."
