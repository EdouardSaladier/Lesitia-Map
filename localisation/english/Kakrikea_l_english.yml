### LEADER DESC
KAK_lua_desc:0 "Artist: ArtChoiAila\n\nAge: 36\n\nLuã was born in the city of Zentra, a bustling municipality in the Kakrikea region, of which Luã currently presides as governor. Ever since his childhood, Luã has resented the reptilians, a hatred that only grew in intensity as he aged. His youth was defined by a series of violent street brawls with the hated reptilian oppressors. He proved surprisingly competent in urban combat, able to take down opponents nearly two times his size with brutal efficiency. This lust for violence did not come without a cost, as Luã was plagued with both overconfidence and a dangerous recklessness in his youth. He failed just as often as he succeeded, suffering brutal beatdowns that left him bloody and scarred. However, his steadfast determination and proficiency attracted the attention of the local insectoid resistance, quickly securing him a role within the movement, and later leading to him gaining a leadership role in the insurrectionist army.\n\nDuring the wars of liberation, Luã was notably bloodthirsty, committing atrocities that stood out even among the unending bloodshed of the post-nuclear horror. No lizardfolk, be they man, woman or child, escaped his burning gaze. His style of command proved successful in this turbulent period, as he ruled with a firm but fair grip on the reins of power. This authoritarian method of ruling largely followed him into his tenure as governor, as he implemented a particularly autocratic rule over his domain. On one hand, he built hospitals, expanded welfare systems, and tried his hardest to improve the lot of the people; on the other, he punished any form of dissent with extremely harsh measures, often involving executions.\n\nLuã is currently very wary of the state of the world. His ultimate goal is to keep his people safe at any cost. He sees a strong federation as the greatest guarantor of security, particularly against the threat of a possible reptilian resurgence."
